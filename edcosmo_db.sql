I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:28] (Intro Music)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:39] <strong>Josepha:</strong>&nbsp;We are back and catching up from our midyear break. And in true WordPress fashion, we&#8217;re just going to start off running. The WordPress Community Summit happened a couple of weeks ago. I&#8217;ve been talking about it on this podcast for a few months now, but if you&#8217;ve missed it and you want a refresher, go ahead and give episode 49 a listen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the Community Summit, there were 125 people, if I remember correctly. And we covered a wide array of topics that were brought to us directly from the community itself. While the event is small, it is specifically designed for gathering and sharing information. So, I&#8217;ve got some top-level trends that I noticed that I&#8217;m going to share with you all today, as well as just like a reminder of what happens after a Community Summit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:27] <strong>Josepha:</strong>&nbsp;So there are three, maybe four, big trends that I noticed. The first one that I noticed is that we have a lot of discussions right now about contributor acknowledgment. That also, for what it&#8217;s worth, came with an unresolved question around whether acknowledgment and recognition are the same. I don&#8217;t think they are the same.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it also was part of a conversation around whether we treat those two things the same. And if they are not the same, should we treat them differently? And et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. For folks who&#8217;ve been around for a bit, you know, that we spent a lot of time working on our contributor recognition a few years back and had really made quite a bit of difference in just reported feelings about how the community felt they were being recognized for their contributions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so a lot of the conversations that we ended up having were around whether or not the project as a whole has changed the way that we provide that recognition or acknowledgment. Or, as an alternative, if the community that is supporting WordPress has changed how they would like to be recognized.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:32] <strong>Josepha:</strong>&nbsp;There were also some questions about whether or not making sure that contributors can see their impact. Like they can say, I contributed 10 hours last month, and these are the two things that I got accomplished over there, and that everyone else can see those things too. So, how we can do that more easily while also not having so many metrics and making the metrics so prevalent that we start to close out the people who are truly just doing this for fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like many of the problems that we have at the Community Summit, this is a bunch of pretty much unsolved mysteries at the moment. But it did; it came up across probably five or six different sessions that I heard about, quite a few that I went to myself, and so contributor acknowledgment and recognition is on our minds again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A second thing that I noticed across multiple sessions, and this one honestly is not a surprise at all, is that there were a lot of questions about what the next big thing is after Gutenberg. I always love when people are asking big questions about what comes next because it means that we all still believe that there will be a next.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:43] <strong>Josepha:</strong>&nbsp;And so I never hesitate when I hear these questions to give some ideas about what I think might be coming. But a lot of the discussions that we were having were around, we think this is coming, but now that we think this is coming, what should we do now to make sure that we are ready for it? One of the biggest assumptions that we all had is that for the CMS, for the software itself, probably our next big area after Gutenberg is going to be something about artificial intelligence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matt pointed out in his presentation that he has told us twice to learn something deeply. One was in 2016 when he said, learn JavaScript Deeply. And then one was in 2022 when he said to learn AI deeply. And so we all kind of are guessing that that is our future area. And so that&#8217;s an area for everyone to spend some time in. Make sure you understand it. Make sure you know it a bit.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing that came up as like a future, where are we going here? It was kind of on the business-y side. It was on a lot of questions about enterprise and are we selling properly to enterprise. Can we sell, can we appeal to enterprise? Whose job is it to sell any of these things? Questions like that. So, lots of business questions again. This is not something that I have any concerns about. I&#8217;m very excited to see that people are talking about it. That&#8217;s been a topic of conversation since, I want to say, February of this year. And so it also wasn&#8217;t a surprise inclusion today. And, and I was excited to see, am excited to see what we get out of those conversations over time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:17] <strong>Josepha:</strong>&nbsp;As far as like questions around what&#8217;s next for the community, I&#8217;m going to address that separately because it was a huge question for everyone. So I&#8217;m going to discuss that as soon as we get finished with this chunk about like the big thing that, that is coming after Gutenberg.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, from an ecosystem perspective. Like a WordPress project operations perspective, this came up a couple of times. Never in as clear a word, a set of words as that, but the question about, like, what are we doing with our tools? Are we making sure that we are keeping the tools that our contributors use maintained and still in an excellent space with features that are useful and, necessary, and requested?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so that is a big question. I do have a lot of questions about that. Also, there are so many tools that I have wanted in order to make organizing the WordPress community better and easier, but also making contributing better and easier. And hopefully, here soon, we have an opportunity to get to some of those.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:16] <strong>Josepha:</strong>&nbsp;So, the third big trend that I kept seeing at the Community Summit is actually about the community itself, specifically about events. So I was part of or listened to many, many, many conversations over the course of the week that were specifically focused on what we&#8217;re going to do with the future of our events. Like are meetups still sustainable? Are WordCamps still sustainable? And that&#8217;s from not only the idea of sustainability that we all tend to know from like an ecological standpoint but also, you know, checking in on the resources. So the kinds of questions that folks had were, is it time to continue having many small events, or is it time to move to a few giant events?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Should we bring back midsized, WP-adjacent events like PressNomics or LoopConf? And if we are bringing those back, do we want to have them be part of a semi-official thing along with a clearly WordPress event and like do joint sales in there? Try to figure out how to get people from one to the other, so that it&#8217;s not just WordPress people that we&#8217;re talking to, but also business people and advanced developers, things like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was also a lot of discussion about whether or not we have gotten too big, should we double down on our grassroots efforts? Just go all the way back to, like, BarCamp style, WordPress in a forest kind of thing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:46] <strong>Josepha:</strong>&nbsp;And yeah, and among all of these conversations, there were questions about the resources that we need. Do we have what we need now? Do we have plans for how to maintain those resources in the future? Do we have enough time? Do we have enough money? Do we have an expertise? The people? So many questions, so many questions. And on the community side of things, we also had a lot of questions that are routine in open source. Like, do we have a pipeline for future maintainers, for future team reps, for future leaders in the project? All of the questions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, those are the three slash four, depending on how you break it out, really big trends that I saw across the conversation at the Community Summit. And I don&#8217;t necessarily know the answers to all of these things. Like, I know what my gut tells me, I know what I believe the answer to be. From my own perspective, but as you&#8217;ve been told many times with many eyes, all bugs are shallow. And so here is what happens next with a Community Summit. So we&#8217;ve gathered all of these things together. We&#8217;ve had these conversations, and now all of the notes from every conversation that we had will be put on make.wordpress.org/summit.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:10] <strong>Josepha:</strong>&nbsp;There, you can do any of the following three things, but at least do one before we get any further. I think it&#8217;s important to remind everyone that no decisions were made at the Community Summit. There are a few things that will come out of the Community Summit where the answer the way forward is really obvious. And so those probably will get done quickly thereafter because it&#8217;s just an obvious thing to do. It makes sense for everyone in the project. It makes sense for everyone who&#8217;s using WordPress. Whatever reason.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So those things will probably move quickly, but mostly not even mostly there were no decisions made. And so if it looks like something is moving quickly there, it is because it makes sense after the fact. So there&#8217;s that. But the three things that you can do in order to take part in this information gathering and sharing that happened at the Community Summit.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Number one, head over to make.wordpress.org/summit and just read the notes. There are a lot of them you can pick and choose based on the teams you contribute to or the topics that are specifically interesting. Or if you have been assigned to read one of these things, obviously, go ahead and read that. But find the notes read them. Take a look at the discussion as far as you can tell it happened and get a sense for what the essential question is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing that you can do while you&#8217;re there is that you can join in that discussion right there in the comments if you would like to. You can, if you feel like your perspective is not quite accounted for in that, obviously leave some comments and let folks know. But also, if you feel like your perspective was accounted for, but there&#8217;s also a very specific question that was not necessarily answered or not even brought up, share those as well. That&#8217;s stuff that we would like to know as we are working through this.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the third thing that you can do is you can take those conversations, and if there&#8217;s anything that looks like it&#8217;s particularly relevant to your local WordPress community, absolutely take those there and have those conversations with them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:23] <strong>Josepha:</strong>&nbsp;And once you&#8217;ve had those conversations, let us know what you thought also in those comments, or take it directly into your weekly teams&#8217; chat, either way. We want to hear what you think about the questions that were brought because you brought them to us. And so you should have an opportunity to tell us what you think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:39] (Music Interlude)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:48] <strong>Josepha:</strong>&nbsp;That brings us now to our small list of big things. My friends, there&#8217;s nothing but big things left for the rest of the year. And so here we go. Number one, uh, I mentioned it quite a bit. There&#8217;s a conversation, an ongoing conversation about the future of events for our community. Right now, there is an open call for ideas, new features for our NextGen WordPress events, especially on the page that exists on WordCamp Central.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, we want to find the most useful and desirable features for a future homepage on central.wordcamp.org that would host a list of all of our upcoming WordPress events. And so we want your opinion there. Please let us know what would be especially useful to you as you are looking for WordPress events to attend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing is that we introduced 2024, the default theme that is coming with WordPress 6.4, was announced. We have had, I think, 32 contributors to it at the time of this recording. And yeah, it&#8217;s beautiful. It&#8217;s got a lot of different implementation options, a lot of default patterns, and curated patterns so that you can get exactly what you want out of that theme. I think it&#8217;s going to make a great default theme, a great starter theme for our final release of the year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, speaking of 6.4, with the release of 6.3 behind us, we are working hard on bringing 6.4 to the community. You can get involved with the development of that. There is a core chat every Wednesday. It happens. I want to say at 21:00 UTC, but I don&#8217;t actually know off the top of my head. I just go when my calendar tells me to go, and I live in the central time zone. And so, my UTC conversion is not the best, but we will leave the actual information about that in the show notes so that you can see it. But you can also go over to make.wordpress.org, and then there&#8217;s a little card on that homepage that tells you exactly when those core meetings are, including the new contributor meeting, which happens every two weeks.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the fourth thing is that there is a successful WordCamp US behind us. That is our final flagship event of the year, which is always exciting. If you missed it, for one, we missed you. And for two, we have you covered. We&#8217;ve got a recap of the event.

On WordPress as a platform for empowerment and change, Josepha shared, “The more people that know about WordPress, the more people can access the incredible opportunities that WordPress can provide.” And that sustaining the platform for future generations ensures these opportunities will persist. She added, “We exist for as long as people want to use our software.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The community is the key to sustaining WordPress, and Josepha touched on the importance of WordCamps, workshops, and events that create value, promote inclusivity,&nbsp; and spark inspiration. WordPress can be a catalyst for positive change in the life of a contributor, end user, or site builder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Concluding her keynote, Josepha asked the audience to think about the story they’d want to tell about themselves and their time in WordPress; and the story they would want WordPress to tell the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What’s Next for Gutenberg</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/EavRd7PtA0Q?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Matt began his keynote with a touch of nostalgia, referring to a comment on his personal blog in 2003 by WordPress Co-founder <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/mikelittle/\">Mike Little</a>, and then looked ahead to the most recent release, WordPress 6.3. As this year’s largest release, it includes new features such as the Command Palette, a quick way (⌘+k on Mac or Ctrl+k on Windows) to search your site and access common commands.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/download/releases/6-3/\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"535\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/08/6.3-Release-Edition-Featured-Image.png?resize=1024%2C535&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"WordPress 6.3 Lionel\" class=\"wp-image-15795\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/08/6.3-Release-Edition-Featured-Image.png?resize=1024%2C535&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/08/6.3-Release-Edition-Featured-Image.png?resize=300%2C157&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/08/6.3-Release-Edition-Featured-Image.png?resize=768%2C401&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/08/6.3-Release-Edition-Featured-Image.png?resize=1536%2C802&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/08/6.3-Release-Edition-Featured-Image.png?resize=2048%2C1070&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/08/6.3-Release-Edition-Featured-Image.png?w=3000&amp;ssl=1 3000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Matt continued, “WordPress never rests, so right around the corner is <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/6-4/\">WordPress 6.4</a> on Nov 7… with some cool new features.” He shared that 6.4, like 5.6, will be an underrepresented gender-led release. A new default theme, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/08/24/introducing-twenty-twenty-four/\">Twenty Twenty-Four</a>, is tailored for entrepreneurs and small businesses, photographers and artists, and writers and bloggers. Additionally, 6.4 will feature integrated font management and Image block options to expand single images for optimal viewing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking further into the future, Matt highlighted Phase 3 of the Gutenberg project, which will focus on workflows and collaboration, “moving WordPress from a single-player to a multi-player tool.” In that spirit of collaboration, a new <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C05PY7QLR5F\">#LMS</a> working group will also bring WordPress learning management systems together to improve the web standards for courses and learning content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond Phase 3, Matt shared thoughts about what it means to support WordPress many years from now.

The letter emphasizes the significant contribution of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) to the EU&#8217;s economy and how the proposed regulations might undermine these efforts. Our shared goal is to further bolster the security of digital products without compromising the values of freedom, democracy, and innovation inherent to both the open source community and the <a href=\"https://european-union.europa.eu/principles-countries-history/principles-and-values/aims-and-values_en\">EU’s Aims and Values</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The letter invites the EU Commission and interested parties to participate in a seminar in Brussels to discuss how we can align the objectives of the CRA with the realities and needs of the FOSS community.

The resources below outline a variety of ways you can help, regardless of your technical expertise.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Download RC3 for testing</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You can test WordPress 6.3 RC3 in three ways:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Option 1:</strong> Install and activate the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (select the “Bleeding edge” channel and “Beta/RC Only” stream).</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Option 2:</strong> Direct download the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/wordpress-6.3-RC3.zip\">RC3 version (zip)</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Option 3: </strong>Use the following WP-CLI command:<br><code>wp core update --version=6.3-RC3</code></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Keep WordPress bug-free—help with testing</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Testing for issues is a critical part of developing any software, and it’s a meaningful way for anyone to contribute—whether you have experience or not. While testing the upgrade process is essential, trying out new features is too.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Encountered an issue? Please report it to the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta/\">Alpha/Beta area</a> in the support forums. If you are comfortable writing a reproducible bug report, you can <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/newticket\">file one on WordPress Trac</a>. You can also check your issue against a list of <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/tickets/major\">known bugs</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>New to testing? This <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/2023/06/27/help-test-wordpress-6-3/\">detailed guide</a> is a great place to start if you’ve never tested a beta/RC release.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Want to know more about testing releases in general? Follow along with the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/\">testing initiatives in Make Core</a> and join the <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/messages/core-test/\">#core-test channel</a> in <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/\">Making WordPress Slack</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Search for vulnerabilities</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The monetary reward for reporting new, unreleased security vulnerabilities is doubled between the Beta 1 release and the final release candidate (RC). Please follow responsible disclosure practices as detailed in the project’s security practices and policies outlined on the <a href=\"https://hackerone.com/wordpress\">HackerOne page</a> and in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/security/\">security white paper</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Update your theme or plugin</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you build themes or plugins? Your products play an integral role in extending the functionality and value of WordPress for users of all types worldwide.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is your final opportunity to test your latest versions against RC3.

This is why I am an enthusiast and one who enjoys contributing back to the community via writing, speaking, and helping organize meetups.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Ihtisham discovered WordPress, his fascination for working with computing grew. He knew he did not want to just work in administration his entire career.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ihitsham describes himself as an ‘introvert’ and therefore the idea of remote work appealed as he could still add value to others through technology. He was intrigued by the thought of the freedom to choose his work hours. However, without access to others who had already transformed their careers and lives through web development, he felt he ‘had no path to follow to turn my dream into a reality.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Challenges become opportunities to learn when there is an active community&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"675\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/07/ihtisham-4.jpg?resize=675%2C900&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Ihtisham Zahoor wearing a sweatshirt with the London tube sign \'Mind the Gap\'.\" class=\"wp-image-15480\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/07/ihtisham-4.jpg?w=675&amp;ssl=1 675w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/07/ihtisham-4.jpg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 675px) 100vw, 675px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Lacking any kind of informed support network to advise or guide him, Ihtisham devoted time to online research to find the next steps he could take. Looking back, he believes that for those who are not in a network with others with similar interests, it can be hard to keep learning and experimenting with new things. Isolation can be a barrier to working in web development.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said: “I think it is not easy to stay motivated when there aren’t immediate rewards for the hard work we do. Sometimes, weeks would go by when my only focus would be to stay motivated rather than give up.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After another two years of combining learning and work, Ihtisham took up using WordPress as a full-time career. He moved to the capital of Pakistan, Islamabad. It was not easy at first. He recalls: “After many failed attempts at getting hired and desperate moments, I finally received an offer from a digital agency as a web developer focused on the WordPress platform.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He added: “Moving to work with a bigger agency was one of the best decisions of my life as it helped me with my professional growth by becoming familiar with the whole WordPress ecosystem in a supportive environment. I was valued for my opinions in the web projects in which I was involved. I was also appreciated and encouraged for the open source work I did for the company.” He summarized his enthusiasm for WordPress like this: “It is really interesting figuring out what is happening in the backends. I like problem-solving and finding solutions which you can do with WordPress.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the Covid-19 pandemic, Ihtisham moved to join a start-up which provides web development services to international clients. He works as a developer and has the opportunity to learn more about client communication and project management. “WordPress has opened up so many opportunities for me. It has been an exciting journey for me with lots of learning every day,” he said. In particular, he has discovered an interest in APIs and regularly uses his spare time to follow tickets in the hope of one day contributing even more to topics.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Give back through WordPress community</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"599\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/07/ihtisham-1.jpeg?resize=800%2C599&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Ihtisham Zahoor speaking at a meetup.\" class=\"wp-image-15477\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/07/ihtisham-1.jpeg?w=800&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/07/ihtisham-1.jpeg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/07/ihtisham-1.jpeg?resize=768%2C575&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It was not just software that made a difference in Ihtisham’s life. Joining a welcoming and sharing community was transforming for him. Recalling those early days of isolation, he values the WordPress community and is wholly committed to the power of open-source software. He now enjoys writing, speaking, and organizing meetups to give back to the community. He has been involved in developing plugins and themes for the platform, which he describes as a ‘humbling’ experience. He is fond of <a href=\"https://islamabad.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp Islamabad</a> and in 2023 is on the organizing team to help bring both WordPress and its community to others in Pakistan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“My first experience,” he said, “was that everyone was so friendly and open to sharing what they have learned, even though they were all busy working. This really had an impact on me. It really helped me and gave me the confidence that I could work with WordPress…. It was a real step forward for me joining this community.” </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/07/ihtisham-WC-Karachi.jpg?resize=1024%2C512&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Ihtisham visited WordCamp Karachi.\" class=\"wp-image-15482\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/07/ihtisham-WC-Karachi.jpg?resize=1024%2C512&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/07/ihtisham-WC-Karachi.jpg?resize=300%2C150&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/07/ihtisham-WC-Karachi.jpg?resize=768%2C384&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/07/ihtisham-WC-Karachi.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A particular meeting in 2018 led to new friendships through the WordPress community. Ihtisham was on a train to Karachi for the first ever Pakistani WordCamp in 2018 and met a group of fellow attendees he now regards as close friends. What impressed him most about the camp was that although he met many people with considerable expertise, they also had a generosity of spirit and humbleness in their willingness to share this knowledge. Now, with this group of friends he is fulfilling another dream of traveling widely across the country. He says these things and other ‘side benefits’ have been made possible by the WordPress community, and for that, he is &#8216;forever grateful&#8217;.<br><br>Ihtisham particularly wanted to share his story through this People of WordPress article to encourage those starting with little or no support to remain persistent. He knows from experience breaking into the tech world can be hard, especially when you may be switching from doing something else and have no ‘track record’ to offer. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He feels he is a living example of how perseverance can lead to success. He offers these words to anyone thinking of making a move into development using the WordPress platform: “I attribute my success (financial and mental well-being) to the open-source nature of WordPress and its amazing community. It would not be possible to learn and use the plethora of free tools WordPress provides if it weren’t an open-source platform. It is for that reason I feel obligated to contribute back to this platform to the best of my abilities.” To those who are finding getting going difficult, as he did, he adds: “Get yourself a clear learning path and just dive in doing WordPress, and things will get better for you over time as they were for me, I promise. Good Luck!”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Share the stories</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Help share these stories of open source contributors and continue to grow the community.&nbsp;Meet more WordPressers in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/category/newsletter/interviews/\">People of WordPress series</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To help you discover more about how to use the WordPress software, there is a free resource from the community, <a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/\">Learn.WordPress.org</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Contributors</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to Ihtisham Zahoor (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/shaampk1/\">@shaampk1</a>) for sharing about his adventures in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you to Abha Thakor (<a href=\"//profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/\">@webcommsat</a>), Nalini Thakor (<a href=\"//profiles.wordpress.org/nalininonstopnewsuk/\">@nalininonstopnewsuk</a>), and Meher Bala (<a href=\"//profiles.wordpress.org/meher/\">@meher</a>) for interviews, the feature and collaborating on images.

Specifically, the menu item in the creation flow will show as “Create pattern/reusable block” until the prompt describing the switch is dismissed in one of the various locations, including the naming and syncing modal:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fbrhammtn3Y?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For folks using block themes, all patterns will be listed alongside template parts in the Site Editor &gt; Patterns section, where you can enter a focused editing mode to make changes. For Classic themes, the prior reusable block management page will now house patterns in a list, similar to the Posts &gt; All Posts view.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"590\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/07/Site-Editor-_-All-Patterns-View.png?resize=1024%2C590&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Patterns section of the WordPress Site Editor with My Patterns selected\" class=\"wp-image-15569\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/07/Site-Editor-_-All-Patterns-View.png?resize=1024%2C590&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/07/Site-Editor-_-All-Patterns-View.png?resize=300%2C173&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/07/Site-Editor-_-All-Patterns-View.png?resize=768%2C443&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/07/Site-Editor-_-All-Patterns-View.png?resize=1536%2C885&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/07/Site-Editor-_-All-Patterns-View.png?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For a complete overview of patterns on your site, all patterns provided by themes and plugins will be shown in this section but without the option to edit directly.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Go further</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With the ability to create your own patterns baked into the creation experience, remember that you can copy the patterns available in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/patterns/\">Pattern Directory</a> and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/patterns/about/\">contribute back</a>, an excellent way to democratize design for every WordPress user and the web.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>For more exciting features coming to patterns in WordPress 6.3, </em><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/07/13/core-editor-improvement-advancing-the-power-of-patterns/\"><em>read on in the Advancing the Power of Patterns post</em></a><em>.

That&#8217;s not healthy.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several others <a href=\"https://twitter.com/konstruktors/status/1701851307454185628\">commented</a> about having <a href=\"https://poststatus.slack.com/archives/CHNM7Q7T8/p1693475484734239\">similar experiences</a> when searching for plugins, finding that the WordPress.com often ranks higher, although many others still see WordPress.org pages ranked highest. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blackbourn <a href=\"https://twitter.com/johnbillion/status/1702035969237504140\">said</a> his chief concern &#8220;is the process that introduced the directory clone on .com either disregarded its potential impact on .org in favor of inbounds or never considered it in the first place &#8211; both very concerning given the ranking power of .com.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The tweet highlighted the frustration some members of the open source community feel due to the perennial branding confusion between WordPress.com and WordPress.org. Nothing short of renaming WordPress.com will eliminate the longstanding confusion, but this is unlikely as Automattic benefits from tightly coupling its products to WordPress’ name recognition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Duplicate content confuses the human + search engines,&#8221; SEO consultant Rebecca Gill <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rebeccagill/status/1702022257533493726\">said</a>. &#8220;Search engines won&#8217;t like it, nor will humans trying to find solutions to their problems. There is already enough confusion w/ .org + .com for non-tech folks. This amplifies it. Noindex .com content or canonical it to .org.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Participants in the discussion maintain that the duplication of the open source project&#8217;s plugin directory &#8220;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/pedro_gaspar/status/1701907080997707966\">creates ambiguity and confusion</a>&#8221; but WordPress co-creator and Automattic CEO Matt Mullenweg contends it also gives plugin authors greater distribution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s providing distribution to the plugin authors, literally millions and millions of installs,&#8221; Mullenweg <a href=\"https://twitter.com/photomatt/status/1701973661110915205\">said</a>. He elaborated on how the cloned plugin directory is integrated with Calypso, WordPress.com&#8217;s admin interface:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>.com has its own plugin directory which includes the .org one, it provides more installs and distribution to the plugin authors, which helps their usage and for commercial ones gets them more sales. The plugins are not altered. .com takes no cut for the distribution.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>When participants in the discussion suggested that other hosts doing the same thing would create a wild west situation for plugin rankings, Mullenweg said he would not mind if the plugins were &#8220;duplicated and distributed by every host and site on the planet,&#8221; as they are all licensed under the GPL.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">If people are providing more distribution to unaltered plugins, I think that\'s great. Happy for all our plugins to be duplicated and distributed by every host and site on the planet.</p>&mdash; Matt Mullenweg (@photomatt) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/photomatt/status/1701983671832441290?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 13, 2023</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Outrage against distributing WordPress.org plugins in this fashion was not universal in the discussion. A few commenters support this strategy and see it as beneficial for the long-term health of the open source project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m all for it to be honest,&#8221; WordPress developer Cristian Raiber <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CristianRaiber/status/1701993257717096738\">said</a>. &#8220;Anyone could scrape those pages but not everyone gives back to WordPress and makes sure it&#8217;s here to stay for the next decades. Controversial, I know. But I prefer we build together instead of alone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I fail to see how this is not an advantage to anyone who hosts their plugins (for FREE) on w[dot]org ?&#8221; Raiber continued in a separate <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CristianRaiber/status/1701991457412767913\">response</a>. &#8220;Is it about being outranked in Google&#8217;s SERPs for brand kws? Why has this generated so much outcry when the intent is clearly beneficial?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This FINALLY solves a friction point for potential buyers. Streamlined plugin installation and usage vs &#8216;here&#8217;s a list of 55 steps you have to take to install my plugin.&#8217; Users want options, different uses cases and all. I want <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://t.co/lvD51DFwBI\" target=\"_blank\">wp.com</a> to make money so they keep growing this product.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>XWP Director of Engineering Francesca Marano suggested that WordPress.com has benefitted from the branding and reputation of .org, which is built by volunteers. She also <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FrancescaMarano/status/1701928039599219066\">proposed</a> that Automattic &#8220;has the resources to do a whole rebranding which would ultimately benefit both projects.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mullenweg <a href=\"https://twitter.com/photomatt/status/1701978533239640196\">responded</a> to these comments, defending WordPress.com&#8217;s efforts in fending off early WordPress competitors and cited Automattic&#8217;s preeminence in contributing back to core, despite taking in less revenue than some larger companies making money from the software:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>Since its foundation, .org has benefitted from the branding and reputation of having a robust SaaS version available from .com, including a free version, something basically no other host does. Over 200M people have used it, and countless started on .com and then migrated to another host. The shared branding made it very difficult for services like Typepad to compete. You want to see what WP would look like without it? Go to Joomla. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>.com has also been the source of countless performance improvements, we deploy pre-release versions of core to millions of sites to find bugs and do testing, making WP releases way more stable for regular users and hosts. <strong><em>No company contributes more, even though many make more from WP than .com&#8217;s revenue.</em></strong> It would have been way easier to fork the software, not merge MU. Most hosts (and many community members) bad-mouth .com while not contributing a fraction back to core. Hosts spend tens of millions a year on ads against .com. I get attacked constantly.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2010, when the WordPress Foundation was created, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/book/2015/11/the-wordpress-foundation/#:~:text=Automattic%20had%20always%20intended%20to,company\'s%20investors%20at%20the%20outset.\">Automattic transferred the WordPress trademarks to the Foundation</a>, after having been the temporary custodian of the trademarks until that time. As part of the transfer, the Foundation granted Mullenweg use of the WordPress trademark for WordPress.com.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This trademark was deliberately secured, and the company does not appear to be open to renaming the platform. This doesn&#8217;t mean WordPress.com can&#8217;t do anything to mitigate the confusion that scraping the WordPress.org plugin directory creates. Participants in the discussion suggested that WordPress.com forego indexing the pages they created for plugins that developers submitted to the open source project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;You can control SEO by telling search engines to not index those pages of open source software developed for .org on the .com domain,&#8221; WordPress plugin developer Marco Almeida <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Wonderm00n/status/1701905853165551802\">said</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I have 20 free plugins on the repository and I don&#8217;t see how my plugins will benefit if we open this pandora box and normalize cloning these pages and diluting the WordPress.org importance on search engines.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Dotcom can help by using schema markup that points to dotorg as the authority (using the \"about\" and/or \"sameAs\" properties).

My name is Nathan Wrigley.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jukebox is a podcast which is dedicated to all things WordPress. The people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case, how you can assist the WordPress project by contributing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast player of choice. Or by going to WPTavern.com forward slash feed forward slash podcast. And you can copy that URL into most podcast players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast, I&#8217;m keen to hear from you, and hopefully get you all your idea featured on the show. Head to WPTavern.com forward slash contact forward slash jukebox, and use the form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today we have Olga Gleckler. Olga is a self-taught developer with many years of experience. After initially pursuing a career in marketing, she turned back to her passion for programming and became a full-time developer. She has been contributing to WordPress for four years, and is currently serving as the Core triaged lead for version 6.4.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, Olga is a maintainer for two components in Core, and actively participates in various teams within the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Outside of work, she&#8217;s also writing a fantasy book, which has a significant personal project for her.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Olga has tried her hand in various teams within the WordPress community, ranging from Polyglots to Training, Support and more. She challenges the commonly held misconception that only coders can contribute to the WordPress project, highlighting the many different ways individuals can contribute without coding skills.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During our conversation, Olga shares some examples of non-coding contributions that can be made to the WordPress project. We talk about the process of submitting patches and contributions to WordPress, discussing the schedule for releases, and the importance of understanding the processes and deadlines.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Olga also emphasizes the essential steps of testing, reviewing for coding standards and ensuring correct documentation in order to make impactful contributions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Olga&#8217;s journey and the WordPress community has been very varied. She discusses how being part of this ecosystem has improved her career prospects, and gained her trust from others. However she acknowledges that not everyone finds their place immediately and may struggle to get started.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She explores how to contribute without becoming discouraged, and shares her experiences in the mentorship program that paired mentors with mentees in navigating the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout the conversation Olga shows a deep passion for the WordPress project and the collaborative nature of the community. She reminds us that contributing to open source projects requires patience and persistence and shares her insights on learning methods, seeking guidance and asking questions in order to make progress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve thought about contributing to WordPress, but are not sure where to begin, this episode is for you. If you&#8217;re interested</p>\n\n\n\n<p>in finding out more, you can find all of the links in the show notes by heading over to WPTavern.com forward slash podcast, where you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so without further delay, I bring you Olga Gleckler.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast today by Olga Gleckler. Hello, Olga!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:08] <strong>Olga Gleckler:</strong> Hi.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:09] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Very nice to have you with us. Olga is going to be chatting to us today about contributing to WordPress, probably specifically around WordPress Core, but we will no doubt in the introduction discover that Olga&#8217;s done a lot more in the WordPress space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Olga, just before we begin, let&#8217;s orientate our listeners a little bit about you. This is a chance to give us your biography. Tell us who you are, how long you&#8217;ve been working with code and computers and in the WordPress space more specifically. You can go as far back as you like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:43] <strong>Olga Gleckler:</strong> Sounds great. I wanted to be a programmer at school, but I messed up with my education and turned out to be a marketer. Then I was a bit disappointed in marketing because you cannot promise to deliver something and actually deliver it. And I switched back to my previous passion to development, and become a developer like a self taught.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And already nine years I&#8217;m working full time as a developer. And four years I&#8217;m contributing to WordPress. To find the WordPress community, it was a big discovery for me, and actually turning point for the whole experience, because WordPress is good, is great, and I liked it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I discovered the community, I started to love it. And since Berlin in 2019, I joined marketing team and several other teams. I contributed to polyglots team, to training team, to support, I love support. And some other teams. And right now I am Core triage lead for 6.4. I was Core triage co-lead for 6.3 as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m a maintainer for two components in Core, so I think I know a bit about how you can actually contribute to Core, and I still enjoying all the process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apart from full time job and contribution, I also want to mention that I&#8217;m writing a fantasy book. It&#8217;s like a big deal for me. It&#8217;s a draft, but it&#8217;s another passion I carry on with myself all around the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:25] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That&#8217;s really interesting. So you&#8217;ve been involved in all sorts of different sides of WordPress. You mentioned there specifically that you joined the marketing team, obviously based upon your past history with studying marketing and things like that. But you found that that maybe wasn&#8217;t the best fit for you. And I guess that&#8217;s going to be part of the conversation today, is that there&#8217;s a lot of different places that you can contribute. And if you join a team and it doesn&#8217;t seem to be the right fit first time, that&#8217;s not a reason to give up, because there are just multiple different ways that you can contribute to WordPress, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:02] <strong>Olga Gleckler:</strong> I love marketing. I cannot kick it out of me, and I still deeply involved in marketing team activities and most of my efforts I am making are between teams. For example, between marketing and mobile team, between marketing and Core team. It&#8217;s something inside me and I cannot kick it out, and I&#8217;m looking at Core tickets from the marketing point of view, and trying to find something significant, something to change, something to improve user experience, to deliver improvement and make a difference and impact.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, yes. I joined marketing team first and I&#8217;m still there, part of the marketing team, but I tried different things like in support, in polyglots. They are all very different and very important as well. So I poke around a lot, and finally I pluck up the courage, with help, and starting to contribute to Core team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:06] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It sounds like on your journey you have dabbled in, you said, poking around, you&#8217;ve had a go at various different teams and you&#8217;ve obviously enjoyed that. In some of the show notes that you shared with me, you list out some of the different things. So you&#8217;ve been involved in several different teams, for example, polyglots, training, and you mentioned support and TV actually, which is kind of an interesting one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That gives us an idea of the different things that you can be involved in. There&#8217;s a whole range there, but I want to drive this message home. The idea that if you&#8217;re in the WordPress community, I think there is a perception that if you don&#8217;t code, you&#8217;re probably not going to be able to contribute. And I think it&#8217;s fair to say that you really don&#8217;t believe that. That&#8217;s just not true. You don&#8217;t have to have any coding skills at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, clearly, if you&#8217;re tackling contributions where code is required, that&#8217;s probably different, but there&#8217;s loads of different ways that you can contribute. And I wonder if you wouldn&#8217;t mind just telling us about some of those different things. Some of the things that teach us that you don&#8217;t need to be a coder to contribute to the project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:17] <strong>Olga Gleckler:</strong> For example, Community team. Community team is handling all the organization processes for meetups, WordCamps, other events and supporting people. It&#8217;s a great and a big job for managers. People who are taking care about things. You don&#8217;t need to be a developer at all. You just need to manage things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this is only one team, and we have more than 22 teams. We have security team. It&#8217;s a bit obscure because obvious reasons, but you can contribute to all other teams. For example, if you are teacher, you can contribute to training team. If you are purely WordPress user, you can contribute to a lot of teams.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example documentation and checking if things are clear, and documentation is actually following the actual result or not, or something needs to be changed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And users, just users without any experience in development can bring a huge value because developers are, we have such flaw because everything is working for us. We know how it should go, and it&#8217;s going in the right direction. And if you don&#8217;t know how it&#8217;s supposed to work, you can poke around a bit and discover some flaws, some doubts, some things which are unclear, and bring a huge value for the code itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And apart from it translation. Polyglot team is your goal if you like to translate. And this is the way to improve your own understanding of English and your own language. Because if you are starting to translate, it&#8217;s become apparent, obvious that it isn&#8217;t easy to do. And you need to put your brain, your heart to this task at hand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And support also a good point for people who want to learn. Because if you, for example, can answer like one question from ten, you can make someone else&#8217;s day better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And in the process, you can learn more and more, and answer more questions, and improve your own skills this way. Just helping other people. And. This is only few teams you can contribute.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And also TV. You can edit videos for other people. You can translate and make subtitles for these videos. You can of course review them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the team everyone is just love right now is photo team. You can contribute your photos to photo directory and contribute this way. If you are a photographer you can contribute to WordPress your ideas in pictures. And of course, if you like looking at pictures, you can go and review these contributions. Because there are some rules, for example, people not, should not be present on these images, et cetera. So there are some rules about quality, et cetera.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we have a lot more abilities. It&#8217;s just top of things and we have a lot more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:37] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> There are, from everything you&#8217;ve just said, so many different avenues that you could go down. And I know, even though you gave us quite a list there, you&#8217;ve still probably only scratched the surface, and if you were to get into the weeds of those teams, I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;d be something for everybody.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a question. It&#8217;s a bit of a personal question. And I&#8217;m really wondering why you do this. And the reason I&#8217;m asking that is because a couple of times in what you just said, you mentioned how it was good for your, your heart. If you like, it made you feel better. But also you said that it was helping other people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so let&#8217;s, for example, say that you answer a support ticket, you&#8217;ve helped somebody out. You&#8217;ve taken them from a place of not knowing, to a place of knowing. So, why do you give up your time? What is it that you get out of it? That may be simply that it makes you feel good, you want the project to be better, so that you can be employed from working with WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It may be that you just enjoy it, that you get to meet new people, attend events, go in any direction you like. I&#8217;m really curious.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:37] <strong>Olga Gleckler:</strong> I think I love everything. I put my trust in WordPress. This is best choice there is. I believe in it, and of course I&#8217;m going to improve, to put back this Five For The Future of myself. To be able to work and use WordPress continuously, and improve it like it&#8217;s obvious choice for people who are working on it. And this is only one way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second, I love all this gathering, all these people with passion. Open minded people and everyone is curious and want to learn and want to do something. And everyone is open and this is a safe environment. We&#8217;re all following code of conduct. So, it&#8217;s completely different space. Open source project. It&#8217;s blow minded. I think how it can change your mind and your perspective.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And of course I got job proposal, previous one, because people know me in the community. And this one is also partly because what I&#8217;m doing, because I&#8217;m well known, a developer. So I was wondering, where is the technical interview? And I was told that there is no need for you, because we know that you are up to scratch already. So it was a good point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So people are amazing. You are improving your skills. You are getting understanding of your level in comparison to other people&#8217;s level. You can learn on their efforts and, for example, patches, examples, documentation, etc. So you are continuously improving yourself. A lot of reasons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:26] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, there are a lot of reasons. Really interesting though. There&#8217;s obviously a lot of desire from you. You obviously enjoy the whole ecosystem and all of the different tendrils and spokes on the wheel. But also interesting to note that you&#8217;ve also done your career prospects no harm by contributing, because you get to the point where you&#8217;ve contributed enough that people are going to start looking for you as somebody that they can trust and rely on. So you kind of jumped over the hurdle of job interviews a little bit there as well. So that&#8217;s really interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay. Let&#8217;s move on to the, another part of the conversation, which is beginning contributing, how you might do that. Because I&#8217;m guessing that for some people, it may be that you hit the ground running and you decide, okay, I&#8217;d like to be part of the contribution community and you find the right project and you find the right thing to do immediately. But I&#8217;m also fairly sure that other people will get discouraged. They&#8217;ll perhaps jump in to the wrong part of the project, or maybe tackle something which is a little bit difficult. They can&#8217;t find the people to help them and so on. So I wonder if you&#8217;ve got any advice about that? Trying to contribute without getting discouraged.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:40] <strong>Olga Gleckler:</strong> Firstly, you need to know what is your learning curve, what is best for you. Sometimes it takes some time to figure it out. For example, some people are purely reading documentation and they are fine with it. But some people need video recording, or they need like a leg up from mentor or just little help for like facilitators.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we are trying to provide all this to make it really easy. Right now, there is a barrier, yeah. But if you want to start to contribute to Core, for example, you need to go to new contributor chat. This is like bi-weekly meeting before the main dev chat. And it&#8217;s better to ask questions. For example, we are like going through the usual script, we are highlighting several documents and links you&#8217;re supposed to browse, but you can be stuck at any moment and actually these meetings are for providing help and we are there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m mostly present there to help if people are stuck. And you need to understand that asking questions, it&#8217;s normal state for everyone. We all are continuously asking questions, and there is no stupid questions, because everyone knows that sometimes it&#8217;s hard to begin. Or even you can miss something obvious, even if you are the smartest person in the world, you can miss something obvious, because it&#8217;s obvious for someone else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, this is how you can start. But in addition to this, we started a contribute mentorship channel in the Slack. This is dedicated channel for contributor mentorship program. We just finished first pilot program when we took 13 people and they got their own mentors. But everyone else was hanging around, and facilitators like me was providing help for people and answering questions. Specific questions, like how to start, how to pick up ticket, what I should do etc. And if I am like with such background, what is better fit for me, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But as well, apart from this, you can just poke around and be present in usual developers chats, but it can take time. So to make things quickly, you need some help from people. And we are actually ready for help. And in the documentation, there is a list of people whom you can ask if you have questions and difficulties. I&#8217;m listed there as well. So people are actually writing for me in DM if they don&#8217;t like comfortable enough to write openly, and asking such questions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if you want your question answered sooner, you can just go to Core channel in the Slack and ask this question openly for everyone to see. And this way you can contribute to other people&#8217;s success as well, because some people not ready to answer this, the same question, and they can see your question and pick up what was written to you. But you don&#8217;t need to jump in the middle of usual, regular chats. You need to wait until open floor if there is like a dev chat going on. So your question can be like, just be flooded with everything else which is happening. Or this is a release going on, no one will be able to answer your questions properly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:27] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, that&#8217;s a good point. Timing is crucial. I&#8217;m just going to circle back to the mentorship program because I think that&#8217;s really interesting. So this is a new initiative, and it may be of interest to people who perhaps have thought about contributing, but have been a little bit unwilling or discouraged, or they had some bumps in the road and decided not to continue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Can you just tell us what that is, how that process works? And I know it&#8217;s new and I know you&#8217;re trying to figure it all out, but what is it? How does it work? My understanding is that you will be partnered, in certain teams, at least anyway, with people who have done the role that you&#8217;re hoping to do and can therefore sort of shepherd you for a period of weeks. Set the expectations for you, give you some advice about where to go for help and all of that kind of stuff. Have I more or less got that right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:17] <strong>Olga Gleckler:</strong> Yeah, it was a pilot, so we were just trying things. The plan for people was decided, how they can proceed. And we received 50 applications, but was able to take 13 people to partner them with mentors. Mentors were people with wide knowledge inside the community and contribution, but not exactly the match on person&#8217;s interests. This person was providing like general support. And actually it&#8217;s works great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They make contribution plans and providing feedback, what&#8217;s working, what is not working. And first two weeks mentees was doing learn courses. And I think 11 of them finished all courses. And then we started sessions, introductory sessions, for many WordPress teams. I had one introduction session for Core. It was also training team, polyglot team, support team, community team, and several other teams.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we put a lot of efforts and most of these sessions are recorded, so you can rewatch them. And this was only the first pilot try. So I think the next time we will do better. And we actually scheduled this to be finished next day after release. So our mentees was able to see the whole process of the release alongside with us, and take part in this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And several people actually contribute to Core. They made patches, they tested things. From our point of view, it&#8217;s a real success and we provided people ability to start quickly, and when there are dedicated people, it&#8217;s much easier to ask questions and get answers, and be oriented in this huge area. And because this mentees got an overview of the whole project, like general.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They was easy to understand what will fit them better. If they like Core, or if they want to translate things, or if they are going to support. Actually, I think one guy answered 200 questions on the support, on the spot, yeah. I have much difference in answering questions. It&#8217;s actually takes time, but he went passionate about this, and it&#8217;s great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:43] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You mentioned in the shared show notes that we&#8217;ve got together for this podcast episode well, I just think this is a lovely phrase, so I&#8217;m going to read it out. You wanted to talk about setting the right expectations and understanding of processes, and the fact that these are the key points to, this is the bit that I really like, joyful contribution. So I wonder if you could outline some of those things, some of the wrinkles, some of the expectations that you need to, not only have set for you, but need to set yourself. Because it may be that there are going to be bumps in the road, things that don&#8217;t quite work out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You may tackle something which ultimately never gets used, or you may think that you&#8217;ve created a solution, I&#8217;m thinking about coding in Core in this particular case, which then has an impact on something else. And so it needs to be iterated on over and over again. So I guess what we&#8217;re trying to say is, it&#8217;s not always going to be plain sailing. Not every contribution that you make might be used or suitable. But there are things that you think you can do to make sure that the process is more likely to work in your favour.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:46] <strong>Olga Gleckler:</strong> Yeah, because it&#8217;s open source. We have a huge community and we are working together. And if you did something like your part, it&#8217;s a bit naive to expect that someone else will pick immediately, like next day. And everything will be done until Friday. It&#8217;s not happening. So if you know that things are taking time and can be more complicated than they look like in the first place, you can adjust your expectations and don&#8217;t expect your shiny new Core Contributor badge next morning on your profile.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You will get this badge, but only when you&#8217;re patch, or testing involvement, or other contribution will be going to release. So you will get this batch after the release, right after. But still it takes time. So if you are like in a hurry, you need to adjust.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And of course, sometimes people are creating a patch, like I&#8217;ve done everything and it&#8217;s not going anywhere. And they are becoming disappointing and interest is going away for contribution. So, what you should do if you did something and no one is paying attention, at least it looks like it. You need to understand that we have more than 8,000 open tickets. So, it&#8217;s a huge thing and we are continuously triaging these tickets. This is why we need continuously triage and component maintainers in the first place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you did something and no one is bothering about it, you should look if this ticket has an owner. Owner is not a person who is doing the patch. This is person who should care, who supposed to care, about this ticket and push it forward. If this ticket has an owner, ping this owner right in the ticket. I did this, please take a look and how we can proceed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this ticket has no owner, you can&#8217;t ping component maintainer. Some components don&#8217;t have maintainers because we have a lot of components and a bit short in maintainers. What should you do? You can turn up on regular dev chat, wait until open floor, and ask about your ticket and what you want to do about this. There will be a lot of seasoned Core contributors around at this point, and your ticket will be noticed. If it will be like good to go further or you need to rework, it will be seen. But at least you will be starting in the right direction forward. So, you need to be a bit pushy about things to make them happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:31] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, I guess that&#8217;s a really interesting lesson, isn&#8217;t it? If you contribute something and it doesn&#8217;t either immediately get noticed, or you feel that it&#8217;s not being noticed, I think that&#8217;s interesting advice. There are different ways that you can make your voice heard, shall we say, and you&#8217;ve mentioned some of those there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You also wanted to point out that there are roadblocks in the timeline of WordPress, where if you submit, let&#8217;s say a patch to something, there are periods in the calendar where things are frozen. And so there are periods, for example, just prior to a release, when we get to release candidate one or beta one, where really, you&#8217;re probably best doing something else because there are freezes. You say that the polyglots team needs to be able to translate strings and things like that. So don&#8217;t know if you want to talk about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:19] <strong>Olga Gleckler:</strong> Yes, sometimes people made something and turn it up, right before the release. And they are disappointed because their patch will not go to this release. Because we have schedule and schedule for the next release, you can easily look on the make wordpress dot org slash core slash 6 hyphen four, for example, right now for this release, and understand the process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if, for example, you are working on enhancement or a feature, they need to be in the trunk before better one. Because it&#8217;s like a significant changes, and they need good testing coverage, et cetera. Big things needs to be, go first. If ticket has a keyword early, it should be even before beta one, like right after the previous release. It should be done quickly, because these things can impact a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then there&#8217;s a release candidate one. If you are working on a bug or if you are anything have content change, it should be in the trunk for release candidate one. Because with release candidate one, we have strings freeze. This is time before release candidate one and actual release for Polyglot&#8217;s team to be able to translate this new, or changed strings, to their own languages and make WordPress great in their own language.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>People need time for this, and we have a huge amount of strings. If you will be starting to contribute to Polyglot&#8217;s team, you will start to understand that it&#8217;s also a big deal and a big job. So if you&#8217;re working on something, you need to fit your patch in this right moment and not after.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And of course, your patch needs to be tested, your patch needs to be reviewed from coding standards, for possible regressions. Possibly you will need to rework some things, or make changes in supporting documentation. For example, each function has this description, yeah, documentation for this function.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is why WordPress is so great. It&#8217;s clear, good written documentation inside code. So everything should be fine before it will go to trunk, even if the thing is working itself. Sometimes you need to cover this code with unit tests and you need to take into account these things as well. Sometimes, most of the time, people are surprised about unit tests.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we have a huge coverage of the code and it&#8217;s actually great. It makes things robust. So if you fix some bug, you are covering this part of the code with unit test to be sure that this will not be happening again. And it&#8217;s actually great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:09] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> There are some places, probably it&#8217;s fair to say, which are better places to start. And again, in the show notes that you&#8217;ve shared, you&#8217;ve alerted me to the fact that it may be that you think something is going to be relatively straightforward. So again, we&#8217;re talking about bug fixes here. So we are talking about the code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it may be that you submit something and it turns out to be more difficult. So what you suggest then is that there are some recommendations for where a new contributor might start. So perhaps not the best idea to find the most difficult and challenging thing first time around. And there is some guidance that you can give in terms of where to look and tickets that are marked in a certain way. So yeah, I wonder if you could get into that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:53] <strong>Olga Gleckler:</strong> Yes, sometimes ticket can be, look very simple, but can turn into a rabbit hole. For example, my best example so far is changing double equal to triple equal. It can bring a lot of regressions, and you will be browsing, trying to fix other things. And most likely this change will not be worth it. And it will be very difficult to convince everyone else that it&#8217;s actually worth doing. And, we will not have ten more bugs because of this one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So sometimes good new patch, like a feature or enhancement, works better. And robust piece of code, when you have like head or tail, it&#8217;s great. And we have tickets which are marked as good first bugs. So if you are browsing tickets in Core track, you can see these tickets by this keyword, by search, custom search. And you can even subscribe to this good first bug hashtag on Twitter and following these tickets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if some ticket is not good for you. If you don&#8217;t like it or you don&#8217;t want to work on UI, for example, or you prefer some other stuff, you can be subscribed to this hashtag, and following along and see what is actually working for you. And start when there will be like right ticket for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But this can be like a bit shock, because a lot of people are subscribed to this good first bugs, they can be taken and already someone else can make a patch. But another thing is that if there is a patch, it does not mean that you cannot contribute because you can review this patch, you can make improvement to this patch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can collaborate with other people on this ticket and make it work, and be great and quick. So, don&#8217;t abandon some ticket if there is a patch. Work is not done with the patch, it&#8217;s just the beginning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:01] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You also make a recommendation to look out for, I guess, if you&#8217;re beginning at least anyway, to look out for tickets where the scope is really clear. And you&#8217;ve also got channels for feedback.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:13] <strong>Olga Gleckler:</strong> Yes, definitely. Because sometimes scope isn&#8217;t clear and it also can turn rabbit hole. So if you have any doubts about tickets, just any, like a tickling feeling inside your head that something is not actually right, you can turn up into the Core channel on Slack, and ask about this ticket.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Seasoned contributors will look through and clarify things for you. It&#8217;s actually better than put up a lot of work and then turn out that something was wrong in the beginning with the ticket and approach is not working. So don&#8217;t waste your time, and be ready to collaborate on the ticket from the beginning with other people. And it&#8217;s what actually is working.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are like staying alone and doing something, you can feel lonely and a bit abandoned, and then disappointed. But if you are open to conversation to other people and can receive help, you can provide this help as well. And we are all working on the final result, on WordPress, and it&#8217;s great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:23] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I like the way that you&#8217;ve rounded off the show notes, because you make the point that whole process of improving WordPress is a continuous learning process. And you may feel that you&#8217;ve just provided lots of your time. Maybe your patch wasn&#8217;t used, or you ran up against something which you couldn&#8217;t work out for yourself, and you needed additional help.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you make the point that it&#8217;s okay, you know. It wouldn&#8217;t be wise to view that as a waste of time because even negative experiences, when you view them from a distance can often be helpful. You may learn something along the way. So negative results, negative experiences may also turn out with time to be positive experiences. And so I guess that&#8217;s kind of a nice way to frame it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:05] <strong>Olga Gleckler:</strong> Yeah, you can like cut out things that are not working and to make clear paths to things which are working. And then the result, everyone&#8217;s contributions count. No matter if you make patch and it wasn&#8217;t working, and someone else went and improved your patch and make some additional things. And another iteration, another approach discovered some other possibilities. Upon your negative result, they will be going forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:37] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Just before we round it off, I do wonder what your thoughts are. It&#8217;s very clear from everything that you&#8217;ve said that you&#8217;re very committed, you&#8217;re very keen. You love all this stuff. I wonder what the state of contributions is? I&#8217;m particularly thinking about things like the pandemic, for example. And whether or not that had an impact in the amount of time that people were able to give.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My understanding is that contributions may have taken a little bit of a dip. I don&#8217;t know where we&#8217;re at right now. Obviously the program that you mentioned for mentoring earlier is a great way to encourage people, to get people back in. But I don&#8217;t know what the situation is. Are people contributing this year in the same way that they were, let&#8217;s say, five years ago? I don&#8217;t know if you have any data on that at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:24] <strong>Olga Gleckler:</strong> I don&#8217;t think any data, but yeah, we had a drop in contribution when pandemic started, because everyone was distressed and we need to take care about our family, our health. So we went through this and not once, but several times having this thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But right now I think we are on the right track. It comes down and we used to new things, and it&#8217;s actually turned to be better for everyone. Because, for example, employers understand that people are able to work remotely. And many people right now are working remotely. They got more time. They are saving time on this road to work and back at home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So they are keeping this time and they can contribute more easily. I&#8217;m an example for this because I&#8217;m working remotely all these nine years. This is why I was able to contribute at the beginning, because otherwise I wouldn&#8217;t have time. So I think pandemic, it was horrible, yeah, but it&#8217;s turned for the better. And right now we can do more. We can contribute more and we can be more flexible in what we are doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:45] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Olga, I think we&#8217;ll wrap it up there. But before we do, obviously, you&#8217;re very keen, and if your passion for contributing has rubbed off on somebody else, and perhaps they would like to talk to you before they jump in with both feet. I wonder if you wouldn&#8217;t mind telling us a little bit about where we can find you. That might be a website or a Twitter handle, whatever you like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:07] <strong>Olga Gleckler:</strong> I think best place to find me is on Slack. Why my name? Because there are several channels, I can put people in the right direction straight away. And because I&#8217;m almost always there. I just want everyone to join. But, yes, if you have problems with Slack, and it can happen, then you can reach me on Twitter, and I will be able to help you join WordPress org, create an account, etc. But, probably you can try it yourself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:42] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Olga Gleckler, thank you very much for joining us on the podcast today. I really appreciate it.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Glekler/\">Olga Gleckler</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Olga is a self-taught developer with many years experience. After initially pursuing a career in marketing, she turned back to her passion for programming and became a full-time developer. She has been contributing to WordPress for four years and is currently serving as the Core triage lead for version 6.4. In addition, Olga is a maintainer for two components in Core, and actively participates in various teams within the WordPress community. Outside of work, she is also writing a fantasy book, which is a significant personal project for her.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Olga has tried her hand in various teams within the community, ranging from Polyglots to Training, Support, and more. She challenges the commonly held misconception that only coders can contribute to the WordPress project, highlighting the many different ways individuals can contribute without coding skills.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During our conversation, Olga shares some examples of non-coding contributions that can be made to the WordPress project. We talk about the process of submitting patches and contributions to WordPress, discussing the schedule for releases, and the importance of understanding the processes and deadlines.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Olga also emphasises the essential steps of testing, reviewing for coding standards, and ensuring correct documentation in order to make impactful contributions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Olga&#8217;s journey in the WordPress community has been very varied. She discusses how being a part of this ecosystem has improved her career prospects and gained her trust from others. However, she acknowledges that not everyone finds their place immediately, and may struggle to get started. She explores how to contribute without becoming discouraged, and shares her experiences in the mentorship program that paired mentors with mentees in navigating the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout the conversation, Olga shows a deep passion for the WordPress project and the collaborative nature of the community. She reminds us that contributing to open-source projects requires patience and persistence, and shares her insights on learning methods, seeking guidance, and asking questions in order to make progress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’ve thought about contributing to WordPress, but are not sure where to begin, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Useful links.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/project/2023/06/23/launch-your-wordpress-contributor-journey-through-the-mentorship-program-pilot/\">Contribute Mentorship Program</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/\">Learn WordPress</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/6-4/\">WordPress 6.4 Development Cycle</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/handbook/about/\">Polyglots Team</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/\">WordPress Core Trac</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Glekler/\">Olga&#8217;s Twitter</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 13 Sep 2023 14:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Nathan Wrigley\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:92:\"Do The Woo Community: La Comunidad de WordPress en Español / WordPress Community in Spanish\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=76497\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:62:\"https://dothewoo.io/spanish-latin-america-wordpress-community/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:454:\"<p>Únete a Juan Hernando, Ericka Barboza y Javier Casares en una animada conversación sobre la comunidad de WordPress en España y Latinoamérica.</p>\n<p>&gt;&gt; The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dothewoo.io/spanish-latin-america-wordpress-community/\">La Comunidad de WordPress en Español / WordPress Community in Spanish</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dothewoo.io\">Do the Woo - a WooCommerce Builder Community</a>	.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 13 Sep 2023 09:23:55 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:48:\"HeroPress: My Journey and Travels with WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=5811\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:148:\"https://heropress.com/essays/my-journey-and-travels-with-wordpress/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=my-journey-and-travels-with-wordpress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12098:\"<img width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" src=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/091223-min.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"Pull Quote: WordPress has given me a wealth opportunity, freedom, and some fabulous friendships.\" /><p>I love WordPress!&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For many years I opened and operated Irish pubs for investors across Europe &#8211; it was lots of fun, it was also exhausting! I was itching to do something that wasn&#8217;t so physically demanding and very restricting on my time. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"kt-adv-heading5811_803067-d3 wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\">The Journey Begins</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I began to learn WordPress. WordPress gave me the freedom I was craving. After a couple of years playing with it I began to build sites for other people, eventually leaving the hospitality industry to build websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back then I had recently moved from Bruges in Belgium to Brittany region of France where I&#8217;d bought an old granite 4 story house built in 1860 to renovate. I was asked by a local French / English association if I would run some in person workshops for some of their members. These people who wanted to build and maintain a simple website themselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most attendees were English speaking Ex Pats from start-up businesses with tiny budgets. Some were French speakers, from local French sports teams and associations, who were wanting to create an information point for their clubs. The clubs and associations had even less budget</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I agreed to run a pilot workshop, which I called &#8216;Build a Simple Website by Teatime Today&#8217; to see how things went. The uptake was for the first workshop was phenomenal. We were limited by room capacity and safe power points to 25 participants.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All slots were taken in under 24 hours. A few days later the association got in touch again saying, &#8220;We know you said lets run a pilot and take things from there&#8221; however we have had another 43 people enquiring so we have opened a waiting list.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Ooooh la la&#8221; I said &#8220;I&#8217;d better work on my presentation skills!&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-being-a-teacher\">Being A Teacher</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It was the first of many WordPress workshops over the three years that I lived in Brittany, I regularly presented to several organisations and associations and I really enjoyed it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a happy accident, it was also the start of me offering website hosting and maintenance too. Initially this was offering very low cost shared hosting space on my server for the workshop participants giving each their own Cpanel. Domains were obtained for each participant prior to the workshops in their own names and I created their hosting accounts prior to the workshops too again with their prior consent. I had also asked each participant to prepare initial pages texts, images and logos if they had one saved in a file on their laptops ready for the workshop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each workshop began with a quick peak at Cpanel for the purpose of creating an email account and to load WordPress on to the domain using Fantastico &#8211; remember Fantastico? Fantastico was superseded by Softaculous and for people people with very little tech experience, wanting to build a website DIY [as a do it yourself project] it offered an easier route than loading WordPress via FTP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From there we covered logging into their WordPress dashboards loading a theme, adding pages adding content to the pages including logo and images from the participants pre prepared folders.<br />For the ease of the workshop we all used the same theme. It was the beginning of the participants WordPress journey. I was delighted;- all of them had a thirst for more in depth learning as a result more workshops followed. Within a couple of years I was super busy again feeling my time was not my own again!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"kt-adv-heading5811_c67890-71 wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\">Moving On</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Working with WordPress meant I could work from anywhere as long as I had an internet connection.<br />It was time for another adventure! This time relocating from France to England where my partner Simon, an international touring musician, and I lived on a narrowboat. I spent several years traveling with the band when they toured, mostly taking photos and keeping the tour bus spic and span! With a regular job that wouldn&#8217;t have been possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In January 2017, after a very busy 2016, we took a quick spur of the moment holiday to Ullapool in the Scottish Highlands, seeking snow! We extended our trip by a week, then another week and then decided we wanted to stay, and stay we did! We took a 6 month Winter let on a holiday cottage, popping off on tour from our new location. Towards the end of the 6 months, we found a cottage on the edge of Strathgarve Forest between Ullapool and Inverness and moved in between tour dates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a stunning, extremely rural location and we love it. Here I have an office in our cottage which benefits from superfast broadband despite our very rural location. After over 30 years of touring Simon trying his best to retire from life on the road.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a bunch of clients that keep me as busy as I want to be, some of whom I have worked with for many years, some are new to me since coming to Scotland.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have been lucky in that lovely clients seem to find me, through word of mouth really. I don&#8217;t advertise and I haven&#8217;t had the capacity to take on new clients for some time. I really don&#8217;t want to expand which may seem strange to many. I have no interest in taking on employees, I have been there and done that in my pub life days. These days I like an easy life enabling me to enjoy where I live and indulging my passion for open spaces and photography.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress has an amazing community around the World, it has brought so many opportunities and so many friendships into my life from all around the world. I love the collaboration.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-giving-back\">Giving Back</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Just last week I was on a Zoom call with a group hosted from the USA. Nathan, the guy hosting the call said to me, &#8221; Hey Sadie, I saw a photograph on display at WordCamp USA last week that you&#8217;d taken. Did you know about that?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Truth was I didn&#8217;t. Nathan said &#8220;I&#8217;ll email it to you I took a photo of your photo!&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next morning I received an email from Nathan and attached was his photo of my photo in a frame with my name and a QR code attached. It was a&nbsp; Fly Agaric photo which I had taken and submitted as a creative commons contribution to the WordPress Photo Directory which is part of the Make WordPress project. I read an article a few weeks ago which was all about getting involved in the WordPress community for the growth and benefit of the community and the future of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Five for the Future&#8217; which is an initiative promoting the WordPress community’s contribution to the platform’s growth. It&#8217;s an open source project, WordPress is created by a diverse collection of people from around the world. The purpose of the project is to encourages organisations to contribute five percent of their resources to WordPress development.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next I read about the Make WordPress initiative and loved everything about it. There are lots of ways for WordPress advocates to get involved and give something back to the fantastic community that WordPress is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Photo Directory grabbed my attention because I am a prolific snapper!! I immediately began to submitting photographs.&nbsp; All photos are submitted to the WordPress Photo Directory are submitted on the basis that they are gifted in to the public domain for anyone to use, anywhere, for any purpose, without the need for attribution. I recently join the Photos team as a moderator too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whilst WordPress hasn&#8217;t made me a millionaire yet! It has given me a wealth opportunity, freedom, and some fabulous friendships. WordPress is a huge part of my life. I love WordPress!</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"kb-gallery-wrap-id-5811_02d44e-72 alignnone wp-block-kadence-advancedgallery\"><ul class=\"kb-gallery-ul kb-gallery-non-static kb-gallery-type-grid

has be nearly one year since <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-org-removes-active-install-growth-data-for-plugins\">WordPress silently turned off active install growth data for plugins</a> hosted in the official plugin repository, a key metric that many developers rely on for accurate tracking and product decision-making. “Insufficient data obfuscation” was cited as the reason for the charts’ removal, but this opaque decision landed without any communication from those who had made the call in a private discussion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a ticket originally titled “<a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6511\">Bring back the active install growth chart,</a>” RebelCode CEO Mark Zahra made the opening plea for thousands of plugin developers who were asking for the return of this data. From those who simply host hobby plugins and enjoy the thrill of watching people use software they made to business owners who need this data to make critical decisions, the overwhelming consensus was that this data is valuable and should be available to those who are contributing to WordPress through plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an appearance on the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wpwatercooler.com/wpwatercooler/ep432-solutions-to-the-active-growth-problem/\">WPwatercooler podcast</a> last year, Audrey Capital-sponsored meta contributor Samuel &#8220;Otto&#8221; Wood confirmed the decision was made through private channels via Slack DMs in a discussion initiated by Matt Mullenweg. He also revealed that the active install growth chart was removed because it was giving inaccurate data and that the data one could derive from it was inaccurate:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>I read through all that discussion and we worked, they worked on it for a long, Scott and several people tried various things before removing it. They adjusted the values, they adjusted numbers. They, they went through a ridiculous amount of iteration and in the end, none of it worked. People were still using it even though it was giving them basically garbage. So finally removing it was the only thing to do. We did have a plan for replacing it. We just didn’t have a plan for replacing it immediately. Nevertheless, giving them active install count numbers that are wrong is more harmful, we felt, to both users and developers interests than simply not giving them at all.&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Wood offered an explanation on the podcast that should have been delivered weeks earlier by those involved in the discussion on official channels. Despite the earlier data being flawed and &#8220;insufficiently obfuscated,&#8221; developers still want access to the raw data, not interpretations of that data. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are the posts that track the history and development of developers&#8217; pleas to reinstate access to the data:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-org-removes-active-install-growth-data-for-plugins\">WordPress.org Removes Active Install Growth Data for Plugins</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-org-plugin-developers-demand-transparency-regarding-the-removal-of-active-install-growth-data\">WordPress.org Plugin Developers Demand Transparency Regarding the Removal of Active Install Growth Data</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://wptavern.com/discussion-on-replacing-plugin-active-install-growth-data-continues-behind-closed-doors\">Discussion on Replacing Plugin Active Install Growth Data Continues Behind Closed Doors</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>During the height of this discussion, developers made many suggestions for different data points that would be meaningful for tracking their efforts, and Matt Mullenweg responded that he was amenable to showing more stats to plugin authors about their plugins. No progress on this effort has been reported since then.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;StellarWP&nbsp;Product Marketing Director&nbsp;Taylor Waldon has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tElizaRose/status/1699134532199538877\">reopened this discussion</a> nearly a year later, calling on Mullenweg to stop restricting access to plugin data from people who are hosting themes and plugins on WordPress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Dear <a href=\"https://twitter.com/photomatt?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@photomatt</a> <br /><br />Without (real) Active Install data, we are not able to measure the success of our free product.

The document describes a common scenario where plugin developers are left in the dark about the growth or decline of their plugins&#8217; active installations:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>Imagine a developer with a plugin with 150k active installations. That developer has effectively 0 quantitative feedback on whether users of his plugin are growing or falling. The download count has a trend, but there is no separation between new downloads and updates. The download count tracks developmental pace as much as user growth. A bump in downloads could be due to a security vulnerability being patched or an influx of new users. The current active installations count is severely rounded and offers no feedback until such a plugin either gains or loses 33% of its users, which are drastically different outcomes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Coleman contends that plugins hosted outside of WordPress.org are able to gather more meaningful metrics. Popular plugins have resorted to including features in non-WordPress.org add-ons or simply removing their extensions altogether from the repository for lack of data. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>His proposal includes a few metrics that would help developers better track their plugins, even if that data is only shown to the authors themselves:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Share a more accurate active installations count with the owners of a plugin.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Share more accurate version number counts with the owners of a plugin.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Differentiate the download count by type: website downloads, dashboard installs, dashboard downloads, updates, other (hits to the zip file).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Allow plugin developers to define custom event triggers to be tallied and displayed to the plugin owners on the plugins .org profile page.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Coleman&#8217;s draft is still in progress and so far he is the only one who has authored the document. If the recommended actions gain any traction, he said he hopes to be part of the contributor team that implements the changes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The intention was to write something that could be proposed to meta team,&#8221; Coleman said. &#8220;But honestly, I thought I would write it up, it would get shot down, and then I could move on with my life. Even if nothing got updated, it would be more clear to me and others which parts of the .org code were in public repositories and which were in the private repositories. It would be more clear what the real issues are with the active installs count.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The communication around the removal of the active install growth chart caused many to lose trust in parts of the WordPress .org project. I thought some clarity around how things work and the real reasons around the changes would help to rebuild some of that trust that was lost.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress.org has always been the most popular distribution channel for the most widely used plugins, but the data available has not kept pace with developer and business needs. Releasing the raw data, while respecting any privacy limitations, would allow developers to extract their own interpretations of that data and allow services to present it in creative ways.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the very least, this data should be available to developers (even if it&#8217;s not public) to help them better track the trajectory of their plugins and the efficacy of their marketing efforts. More data can only serve to improve the WordPress ecosystem&#8217;s ability to continue powering a multi-billion dollar economy. There are undoubtedly many technical requirements for supporting the release of this data, and they need to be prioritized if WordPress.org is to continue attracting the best products for distribution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This is not about vanity metrics or inflating numbers for marketing purposes,&#8221; Coleman said. &#8220;This is about getting valuable feedback on the relative use of a plugin hosted in the .org repository so developers can make informed decisions and investments in those plugins.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 12 Sep 2023 20:24:26 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:102:\"Do The Woo Community: More WCUS Insights from Matt, Seth, Shambi, Jeremy, Mike, Patrick, Bud and Katie\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=76485\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:95:\"https://dothewoo.io/more-wcus-insights-from-matt-seth-shambi-jeremy-mike-patrick-bud-and-katie/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:520:\"<p>Reflections and highlights of WordCamp US 2023 from Matt Medeiros, Seth Goldstein, Shambi Broome, Bud Kraus, Jeremy Freemont, Mike Demo, Patrick Rauland and Katie Keith</p>\n<p>&gt;&gt; The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dothewoo.io/more-wcus-insights-from-matt-seth-shambi-jeremy-mike-patrick-bud-and-katie/\">More WCUS Insights from Matt, Seth, Shambi, Jeremy, Mike, Patrick, Bud and Katie</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dothewoo.io\">Do the Woo - a WooCommerce Builder Community</a>	.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 12 Sep 2023 09:03:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:79:\"WPTavern: WordPress Training Team Seeks Community Feedback on Learning Pathways\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=148690\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:90:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-training-team-seeks-community-feedback-on-learning-pathways\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2845:\"<p>Earlier this year, the WordPress Training Team published the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/training/2023/05/30/analysis-of-the-individual-learner-survey-results/\">results from the Individual Learner Survey</a> completed in 2022. The goal of the survey was to identify the most useful and high-impact resources and content for <a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/\">Learn.WordPress.org</a> and guide the future development of this community learning tool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the main takeaways of this survey was the need for a clear, structured, and user-friendly approach to presenting Learn WordPress content. This need was also confirmed by feedback from WordCamp Europe Contributor Day attendees.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a result, the training team launched the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/training/2023/07/07/project-thread-learning-pathways-on-learn-wordpress/\">Learning Pathways on Learn WordPress project</a> in July of this year. The objective of this project is to create and launch progressive user-friendly learning pathways tailored to different types of Learners on Learn WordPress. The training team anticipates that this project will be a year-long effort, working collaboratively with multiple different teams, including the Meta and Marketing teams. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since WordCamp Europe, the Training Team has started the process of drafting rough outlines for learning pathways intended for Users, Designers, and Developers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In August, Automattic-sponsored training team contributor Wes Theron published a post on the training team blog, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/training/2023/08/24/looking-for-feedback-learning-pathway-outlines/\">asking for community feedback</a> on the proposed learning pathways. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I asked Theron why he feels this project is so important, and what feedback he would like from the community:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>The Learning Pathways project focuses on improving the educational experience on Learn WordPress by creating personalized learning journeys for various learner profiles.

Together, the companies now employ more than 400 full time team members, forming a digital powerhouse with expanded market reach across mobile and publishing sectors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Fueled has built stand out iOS and Android apps – several of which I’ve personally used – for clients like <a href=\"https://fueled.com/projects/warby-parker\">Warby Parker</a>, <a href=\"https://fueled.com/projects/verizon/\">Verizon</a>, the United Nations, and even Apple themselves,&#8221; 10up President Jake Goldman said. &#8220;Just as 10up has <a href=\"https://wildsymphony.com/\">built some great mobile applications</a>, Fueled has executed notable works in the web application space for clients like <a href=\"https://fueled.com/projects/wsj\">Wall Street Journal</a> and <a href=\"https://fueled.com/projects/wirecutter\">The New York Times</a> – but content management systems and editorial experience has never been a core focus and strength. Until now.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The merger transaction was made possible by investment  from <a href=\"https://www.insigniacap.com/\">Insignia Capital</a>, a firm that previously invested in Fueled. Insignia has made Fueled&#8217;s merger with 10up its first major growth investment, paying to restructure the companies&#8217; ownership model. All parties invested in the merger hold meaningful shares, with none of them holding a majority share.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Goldman said 10up owners rolled over meaningful equity into the joint business, &#8220;but there was also a very healthy purchase of 10up equity to make this possible.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>10up&#8217;s announcement hinted at more acquisitions in the newly combined companies&#8217; future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Insignia brings a whole new class of financial and investment capabilities to 10up and Fueled, with an appetite for responsibly paced growth through acquisition,&#8221; Goldman said. &#8220;They don’t just bring capital – they also bring expertise and impressive connections.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He further elaborated on their acquisition strategy as seeking to expand their combined capabilities &#8220;to compete with the biggest digital transformation agencies:&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>In the broadest of terms, I think that we’re pretty open minded to what we find in the market, but opportunities that meaningfully expand what we can offer &#8211; shoring up weaker spots in our capabilities &#8211; are going to be the most attractive. As examples, while we’ve each done CRM and CDP integration work and strategy, I’d imagine a first rate CRM and/or CDP consultancy with some great case studies and clients would be the kind of opportunity that would be particularly interesting.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Open Source Contribution Will Continue To Be a Priority at 10up</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Nearly 12 years after Goldman started 10up with what he said was &#8220;a small personal savings account and the sweat equity of more than a decade making websites and other media,&#8221; he is no longer the sole leader of the organization and will take on the role of Partner in the merged companies. Integral to the success of 10up, which Goldman has scaled to $40M+ in annual revenue, is its consistent commitment to supporting the open source ecosystem from which it has derived millions of dollars in value. Fueled acknowledged this in its <a href=\"https://fueled.com/blog/fueled-merges-with-10up/\">announcement</a> about the merger:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>10up has long held a commitment to the open web, and open source contributions as a core value. This will remain a priority, especially towards the WordPress community, and will be further strengthened by the additional market reach gained from the merger.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Fueled shares this same ethos, which they intend to continue cultivating following the merger.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Fueled has always been supportive of open source, even if their part of the market (mobile apps) hasn&#8217;t embraced that model in the way web CMS has,&#8221; Goldman said. &#8220;They have open sourced projects (in fact, we incidentally found that we were using one!), and, like 10up, have fully embraced and focused on open technology solutions like NodeJS and React for web applications.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the most recent WordPress 6.3 release, <a href=\"https://jeanbaptisteaudras.com/2023/08/contribution-stats-for-wordpress-6-3-lionel/#:~:text=WordPress%206.3%20overall%20stats,which%20is%20a%20great%20ratio!\">10up had the second most contributions by company</a>, with 290 contributions from 16 people, superseded only by Automattic, which boasts 83 contributors. </p>\n\n\n\n<p> </p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://jeanbaptisteaudras.com/2019/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/wp63-contributor-company.svg\" alt=\"\" />image credit: <a href=\"https://jeanbaptisteaudras.com/2023/08/contribution-stats-for-wordpress-6-3-lionel/#:~:text=WordPress%206.3%20overall%20stats,which%20is%20a%20great%20ratio!\">WordPress 6.3 contribution stats</a>\n\n\n\n<p>10up has consistently been among the top contributors to the software, which has been essential to the world-class publishing experiences the company has built for its clients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;That commitment to giving back to the web, making sure there&#8217;s a ladder for the next generation of developers to climb, and helping open technologies thrive remains with us,&#8221; Goldman said. &#8220;Our new business partners understand that this is deeply intertwined with 10up&#8217;s identity, and perhaps more importantly, our <em>success</em>. It&#8217;s not <em>just</em> a generosity thing – it&#8217;s also good business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Merging with and investing in 10up would be pretty foolish if you aren&#8217;t comfortable with the tools and platforms we use and prefer, most especially the web&#8217;s most popular open source CMS, and you can bet that being comfortable with that, and researching that question, was essential to their comfort with merging. In many ways, that&#8217;s a validation for WordPress.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">10up and Fueled Will Gradually Merge Services and Administration, Pursuing Large Scale Digital Transformation Clients</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>10up and Fueled will largely operate as two companies and close partners for the time being, sharing leads and pursuing customer growth together. Goldman said the vision is not to simply have web publishing/WordPress customers and separate mobile app customers but rather to go after large scale digital transformation projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;That means having a fully integrated way to deliver everything from the mobile apps, to the website and CMS, to advanced e-commerce and CRM integrations (even if we may only provide one of those services to some clients),&#8221; he said. &#8220;That means we&#8217;re not just operating as separate companies in the <em>future</em>, but truly merging and unifying our companies from leadership and sales on down through project and product management, user research and design, and engineering delivery.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given that both brands hold considerable weight and influence in their respective markets, Goldman said they agreed &#8220;it would be incredibly foolish to discount that and rush to a single brand.&#8221; Instead, they plan to explore how the companies can work together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We honestly don&#8217;t know where we&#8217;ll land on the external brand question, and didn&#8217;t think it was fundamental to the question of merging,&#8221; Goldman said. &#8220;We&#8217;ll be exploring and researching that question together, and any change would, again, be gradual and planned.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We all similarly agree that when we think out into the future, whether that&#8217;s 12 or 24 months from now (probably something in between), that we probably don&#8217;t want two separate, external, top line company brands competing for attention and oxygen in the space, to say nothing of competing for internal focus and resources.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said that could play out in a number of ways, and may be a data driven decision. For example, 10up could evolve to be the brand name for the WordPress engineering services team or the company&#8217;s open source and productized solutions. Nothing has been predetermined about the branding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the meantime, it appears to that the combination of companies will be a more gradual merging of services and administration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;In the mid term, maybe the next year, we want to focus on building a highly collaborative world class sales and growth operation, unifying back office (benefits management, financial operations, recruiting ops, etc), and looking at where some of our smaller capabilities and disciplines that aren&#8217;t very specific to 10up or Fueled delivery might benefit from joining forces and achieving some economy of scale,&#8221; Goldman said.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 21:12:15 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:11;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"WordPress.org blog: The Month in WordPress – August 2023\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=15933\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:70:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2023/09/the-month-in-wordpress-august-2023/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12997:\"<p>August 2023 marked another exciting chapter in WordPress, with the Community Summit and WordCamp US bringing the community together for meaningful discussions, knowledge sharing, and learning.

In today&#8217;s episode, we will talk about Gutenberg&#8217;s 16.6 and some community contributions as well as features that are still in the works, that we wanted to highlight today. I&#8217;m your host Birgit Pauli-Haack, curator at the Gutenberg Times and WordPress developer advocate, and a full-time core contributor for the WordPress open source project. A special guest today is Nadia Maya Ardiani, contributor on the training team and WordCamp Asia, and that&#8217;s where we met for a chat at dinner, a lunch, and we did&#8230; Yeah, it was just fabulous to meet Maya and we always found a topic to talk about and to laugh as well. I&#8217;m so happy you join me today to review the Gutenberg plugin release and connect about WordPress. So greetings to Indonesia. How are you today?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani</em>: Thank you, Birgit, for having me. It&#8217;s so good to be here, and thank you as well for being the first WordPresser ever to be featured in Hostinger&#8217;s WordPress Expert Article Series.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh, thank you for having me. Yeah, it was a fun interview.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani:</em> Because it&#8217;s only fitting to start the series with one of the people who have been doing such significant contribution to the platform, and that&#8217;s you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Thank you. So what else do you contribute to on WordPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani</em>: Okay. So yeah, I&#8217;m a contributor on the training team and in the team I&#8217;m also a translator coordinator for Indonesian locale. And yeah, I love contributing for the training team because I enjoy sharing complex information in a more accessible way, making the knowledge more accessible for a wider audience, which is also related to my day job as a content writer in Hostinger. And yeah, in my day job, I write WordPress tutorials in the form of WordPress website articles and script for YouTube videos. And I also write about WordPress community activities like Word camps and about WordPress journeys of awesome WordPress community members, that&#8217;s like you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Well, thank you. Thank you. I know that another interview was with Michelle Frechette on the Experts Series. Yeah, great job there as well. It&#8217;s really fabulous to kind of follow up on that. Yeah, I&#8217;m so glad we stayed in touch after WordCamp Asia and you just returned from WordCamp US. So how was it and what are your takeaways for that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani:</em> So yeah, it&#8217;s my first word WordCamp US, so it&#8217;s very new to me. And I also volunteered this time, and I didn&#8217;t get to attend a lot of sessions, but it always awesome to meet and have a chat with fellow WordPress enthusiasts because you don&#8217;t get to meet them every day. And I think it&#8217;s one of the WordCamp’s struggle to decide between attending the session or talking and catching up with everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, I know I have this every time that I have my sessions checked off to say, &#8220;This I want to do,&#8221; and I put them in my calendar and then I stay in the moment with talking with somebody and then whoosh, the time is gone and I have to catch the livestream. Totally get it. And for WordCamp US, there is a lot of FOMO that I had to endure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani</em>: Yeah, yeah. There are actually lots of interesting sessions, but as we know, we can just catch up with the sessions in WordPress YouTube channel or WordPress.tv. But yeah, I actually really want to see the one with NASA and the White House because we get to see WordPress implementation in those two websites. Because for me, it&#8217;s the most interesting thing about the session is we can see how WordPress is really for everyone because many of us in the end users, we think WordPress is only for hobbyists, but it&#8217;s actually can be for big organizations like this that require fairly customized website and high level security.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So true, so true. Yeah, the bandwidth is really broad. I&#8217;m glad you got to see that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani</em>: And I also really love about the contributors day because as always, it&#8217;s the time for us to work together with other contributors who we usually only meet on screen. And so far the WordCamp US is kind of unique because usually we all gather in one big room, all of the teams are gathering in the same place. But this time teams which works closely related, were spread in multiple rooms. I actually love the comradery of being in the same room as all contributors, but this time I also love it because there was no confusion about which table belongs to which team, and also more space or creating breakout room. For example, in training team, after onboarding the new team members, we can split into this is the people who are interested to be content insider. This is for people who are interested to be content creator. And also since the training team is in the same room with the Docs team, there we can discuss more about cross collaboration effort regarding how to better work together with the backlink material and each other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh, that&#8217;s interesting. Yeah, I can see that there&#8217;s some overlap between the Docs team and the training team, and the more we can streamline the processes between the two, I think the better it is for WordPress users to find the right material at the right time. Awesome. Well, thank you so much for this report back from WordCamp US and how you found it from a contributor point of view. Yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Announcements</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear listeners, we have one announcement that we wanted to share with you is about WordPress 6.4. So WordPress 6.4 is in less than three weeks away. WordPress 6.4 beta is only three weeks away. Don&#8217;t get scared. The last Gutenberg version for features will be 16.7. Today we are talking about 16.6, so there&#8217;s only one more Gutenberg plugin release to go and release candidate for 16.7 is scheduled for September 20th.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s one week longer than the usual two-week schedule. And so all the new features will need to be merged by that time. And after that, only bug fixes and fixes for blast features can be added to the WordPress release. So it&#8217;s the time to test all the Gutenberg plugins versions that go into, it will be 16.2 all the way to 16.7 and whatever bug fixes come in 16.8 and nine.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The final release or the release for 6.4 is scheduled for November 7th, and so that&#8217;s still about a month and a half away, two months away. So just so you&#8217;ll get the timeline a little bit, we will repeat this on the next shows as well when we&#8230; Next time is with Tammy Lister. She&#8217;s on the editor tech lead, so we will have some more information about 16.4.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani</em>: It&#8217;s my first time to see how many improvements that come with one version of Gutenberg. So it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh my God.&#8221; So every time we release one version of WordPress, that must be a huge improvement. So by seeing the rundown, that&#8217;s the first time I realized that how much is the improvements.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Community Contributions</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, that&#8217;s a change log and that can be overwhelming indeed. And the last five versions kind of go into WordPress. So yes, so 16.2 and three had major jumps in improvements to the site editor and to the block editor. Especially because 6.3 and 6.4 wrap up the phase two of site editing. But 6.4 also will ship with the new default theme and amply named 2024, and it&#8217;s also expected to be in early November together with the 6.4 release, the designs are already available and you can follow up on the introduction post on the Make WordPress core website. We mentioned it on one of the previous episodes as well, but I really like to talk to you about, Maya, you looked at it and what do you think about the new theme?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani</em>: As an end-user, I&#8217;m really excited to use this theme because this one is aimed to be a multi-purpose team, right? I sold three use cases in the Make WordPress website, one specifically tailored for entrepreneurs and small business, one for photographers and artists, and one for writers and bloggers. So it provide a better look into how the theme would look like when it is used to display lots of images, when it&#8217;s used to show multiple chunks of text and how it may look like as a landing page, which is so cool because I can instantly imagine, &#8220;Oh, this is the stuff that I can do with this theme.&#8221; Since it&#8217;s a collection of templates and patterns which combine into a theme, it&#8217;s even cooler because the patterns include in it, it has various home templates or different use cases such as out page and then project overview are SVPs. So yeah, it&#8217;s basically very handy for no-code people because we can just&#8230; Yeah, I want to make this, I want to make this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, I think that&#8217;s exactly what you&#8217;re saying is that it gives you a vision or an inspiration of what your website could look like when you use that theme and then gives you all the tools. I like that it also thinks about&#8230; Or the creators think about the full page templates so you don&#8217;t have to assemble all the things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani</em>: Yeah, it&#8217;s very nice to not have to create everything from scratch because sometimes it can be intimidating to start from a pure blank slate like that. At least that&#8217;s for no code people like me. But this one is the default color and typography style are already versatile and very timeless. It gives professional and elegant flare in general with the understated color and the sunset of point variation. So it can be used for any, many needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And with the site editor providing all the design tools, you can really make it your own in terms of the look and feel. And I really like that. I think it&#8217;s the first default theme that&#8217;s not very opinionated about the design that is only for a niche or for a certain topic or so. It&#8217;s more really that is actually the purpose that you just said is that many people can see themselves building with that theme, and I am really happy that comes out of it also for you. Yeah, there is the Figma I can share in the show notes. I&#8217;ll share also the link to the Figma file where you can kind of browse the designs. It&#8217;s right now in development, the report from the leads of Jessica Lishick and Maggie Cabrera and they both were at WordPress US Contributor Day and they had about 31 contributors at the theme table who wanted to work on the theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there is some rapid development going on, and I will also share the GitHub report link where it&#8217;s all happening with the issues and the PRs and everything, and where you can see all the discussions. The GitHub report will closer to release candidate, it will disappear and then it will be on track because that&#8217;s just for development. Default themes are then housed with the core files on a track. Yes, in the repo, yes. Another community contribution gets you all the way from that no-code site builder, single site builder, private person to all the way to the enterprise level of using WordPress. And there is a new guide for WordPress for Enterprise Together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So where the major WordPress agencies that deal with enterprise clients and there are Big Bite and 10Up and Alley, Human made Inpsyde and XWP and they got together and in WordCamp Europe as well to think about can WordPress be advertised or shape the conversation with enterprise IT people and CEOs about using WordPress for content management system on their large scale organizations. And they came together and created a free guide for WordPress for enterprise. It highlights all the high profile companies like CNN, Vogue, Google, Spotify, the White House, and many more, now NASA and also responds to some of the misconceptions that are still out there. Mainly the one that it&#8217;s not secure that it&#8217;s only for blogging and all that kind of thing. So it&#8217;s a really good guide that you as a small agency can certainly also use in parts for talking to your clients and to your customers about things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani</em>: I like it that this guide is easy to read because sometimes people from big enterprises are not really tech-savvy. So having it with layman&#8217;s term, it can deliver the knowledge better to a wider audience about the possibilities for creating a customized platform to fit any organization. And yeah, I checked the chapters in good discussion about platform security, scalability, internationalization, solution, cost and value. Those are the stuff that enterprise really cares about. I think it shows one of the beauty of the WordPress community, everyone&#8217;s coming together for it, but to constantly improve the platform and to share to others that this is a solution you can use. And it&#8217;s really nice to see how these agencies provide insights related to aspects that are important for enterprises.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And I also like that they kind of highlight the open source part, which scares enterprise, but the open source part that there are hundreds of contributors that are actually maintaining the code and doing all the performance testing. We have this awesome performance team that has brought down the load times of WordPress out of the box just for 6.3, around 20%, which is huge when you think of the millions and millions of websites that use WordPress. And I saw a statistic that already 50% of WordPress is now 6.3 installations. So the community has really reacted fast to the new versions and that will also be for 6.4. So we will share of course the article from WP Tavern that talks about it. We also share the blog post about it and with a link to download it. You don&#8217;t need an email address to download it, so it&#8217;s all free out there for you to use and to contemplate. Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What’s Released &#8211; Gutenberg 16.6</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Which brings us to the section what&#8217;s released and right now, we&#8217;re talking about Gutenberg 16.6 that was released earlier this week and Vincente Canales was the release manager for this. And in his release post he shared the change log and as well as some highlighted things. And we follow suit of course, and the first thing that we wanted&#8230; Most of it, there&#8217;s not really some big stuff coming in 16.6, but it was some great quality of life changes that make working in it much smoother and less confusing and more consistent together. But there are few highlights that we wanted you to know about.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Enhancements</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So the first one is it says I needed to read through the PRs and look at the videos to try it out myself to actually actually know what it means. So it says, &#8220;Capture toolbars,&#8221; in the quote block or navigation block. What it means is that the toolbars for child blocks or inner blocks are now seamless attached to their parent block and offering a more intuitive and organized editing experience. They don&#8217;t jump around that much, which is sometimes a little disconcerting and distracts you from the work that you actually wanted to do. Right now they are in place for the navigation block, the list block, and the quote block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani</em>: Yeah, I think this one makes the publishing experience way more enjoyable. Because sometimes you just move a little and the block will follow through like, &#8220;Oh my god, can you just stay right there?&#8221; And I publish articles in daily basis, but it&#8217;s only recently that I discovered the top toolbar feature that we can activate by clicking, what&#8217;s the name?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: The options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani</em>: In the right panel. Yeah, the block tool work can be annoying sometimes. So having this improvement capture toolbars, this will be&#8230; And making the toolbar staying at the same nearby spot like this, I will definitely prefer this one than the following.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, me too. I found that some users are actually struggling with the concept that depending on which block is focused, that they have a different toolbar from the parent block. And to get to the parent block, you have to know that you need to click on the leftmost kind of button to get to the parent block again. And I think I haven&#8217;t found a better way to get to it to kind of imagine a better UI for that. But I think with tying both toolbars together and just switch in place and not also move it, it&#8217;s a much better experience. Yes, definitely. Another one is that for the query pagination block, it was that you only had one or two&#8230; The pagination block is the block that you have underneath your loop block or the query loop where it says, &#8220;Okay, get me next pages,&#8221; from that query from that loop of next pages of articles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And when you look at it, there were only two&#8230; You only saw the first two ones, and then the last two ones. But you couldn&#8217;t click to, if you say, the third one or the fourth page because you knew it was things on there you had to click on next, next, next to&#8230; You didn&#8217;t find a&#8230; And now a user can determine how those numbers in the pagination block are actually organized. You can say, &#8220;Okay, give me four numbers in between.&#8221; That&#8217;s a really good improvement considering that that was possible before in the classic theme very much so. But this is kind of getting it all feature priority and it really is a good improvement. It&#8217;s such a small thing, you would think, but navigating a list of posts deeper into it, they&#8217;re not just the first page, sometimes is really needs some support, some better support there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani</em>: Sometimes more like things that at the front end it seems like a very simple change, but I believe that under the hood that there must be many things going on, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And then now you have in the sidebar, you have additional fields where you can put in numbers and some more explanation, if my explanation wasn&#8217;t helpful at all. And the next part is that the list view now has a keyboard shortcut for duplicating blocks. So if you are working through a list view by keyboard and you now don&#8217;t need to change controls to duplicate a block, you can just use command shift and D, and then that block that was just focused is duplicated. This definitely helps with rapid content creation and laying out some articles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani</em>: As a content writer, I definitely agree with this one. This will be very time-saving.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Super, yeah. 16.6 Gutenberg also adds a custom taxonomy for user created patterns. So WordPress 6.3 came with the feature that you now could create synced and unsynced patterns, but if you have three or four or 15 of those, it was hard to sort through them. So now you can use some taxonomy labels for your creative patterns. So you can give other editors on your site a little bit more help with what are those patterns that Birgit created and now you can help them to be a little bit more organized here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani</em>: So this can be for the synced and unsynced patterns?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani</em>: Yeah, this will be&#8230; Having a feature to organize it, it definitely will be beneficial for the content creators also because we can easily choose which one we want to use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, and you can drill down because I can see that an organization has created at least 10, 20 patterns depending on how the different content they provide. And the beauty of it is, it&#8217;s actually based on the default taxonomy patterns, not patterns, API that comes with WordPress because the patterns are custom post type. So the built-in taxonomy is now just surfacing on the editor. There was not a whole lot of&#8230; There was development being done just to make it into the site editor, but the underlying backend was already there. So it&#8217;s good to have a fallback like that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Bug Fixes</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So now we are coming to the bug fixes and there&#8217;s just a few that we wanted to point out. Maybe just one, no, maybe two or so. Do you want to take that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani</em>: Okay. So for the bug fixes, I like this one about the post notification link, which is the remove unnecessary space between rows and label. I think for some end users this might look like a very simple improvement that almost unseen, but I believe for those who work around design a lot will be happy with this. &#8220;Finally, I already feel it sometime ago.&#8221; Because it&#8217;s only a very tiny character, isn&#8217;t it like the space between the arrows and labels? But once it removes it, it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Yeah, this is how it should look.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, it gives you a consistent look and don&#8217;t really get that. That&#8217;s fixed now. And then also for the block styles, there&#8217;s the preview of the popover is now working also with right to left sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani</em>: Yeah, I think this is also one of the great examples of a form of striving for inclusivity and equality in WordPress because it makes a site building experience equal for everyone, whatever language you use, including the right to left languages like this. So when your site using the right to left languages, you will have the exact same experience as everyone in the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And sometimes that kind of falls a little bit through the cracks. So some head bubble for those who record those issues on the GitHub report so they can be fixed if they are not working right. In the site editor, there&#8217;s one bug fix.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani</em>: About the unified delete button style in the dropdown menu and making it red. So I think it&#8217;s also a nice improvement, especially for end users who still learn to use WordPress for the first time because it&#8217;s easier to tell the effect of clicking this button. When you see it previously it&#8217;s blue. So people might just, &#8220;Okay, I will just try to delete this,&#8221; and turns out it delete all the stuff that they actually don&#8217;t want to delete. But by making it red, it&#8217;s making&#8230; I think it&#8217;s related to psychology of color, people can be more considerate when they offer this button. This one will do a significant effect to my content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: It&#8217;s kind of, &#8220;Stop. Think what you&#8217;re doing.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani</em>: Oh, what is it? What is it? It&#8217;s red. I will avoid doing something with this because it can avoid accidental deletion.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Experiments</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And that&#8217;s part of really the small changes that have big outcomes. So the Gutenberg 16.6 also brings a new feature, new API and that&#8217;s called lock hooks. It was introduced one or two Gutenberg versions earlier and labeled as order inserting blocks. And the PRs that are accompanying it are still referring to that, but it&#8217;s on activation plugins now can have the capability to order insert blocks, enhancing the integration and automation between the plugins and the Gutenberg editor. So the examples that you see in the PRs&#8230; And I would recommend to look through the PRs to kind of see how it all works. And the change log has the list of the PRs in there. So what is it useful&#8230; And I think we talked with Ellen about it, Ellen Bauer on the previous episode about it. So you can add a like button to a comment section or a card icon to the header with this API and any other thing that you want to add to a block that&#8217;s automatically added for the user.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The user now also has with the&#8230; They created now the block inspector panel and have a plugin section there. So it identifies the plugin that added a block and you can toggle the appearance or disappearance of it on your templates and on your posts. So depending on what the use case is for this plugin that you installed on your site. So this very much expands the capabilities of the block editor for plugin developers outside of adding custom blocks or adding additional features in the sidebar. Now you can add a few content as well. So this is a really good new feature and it will come to 6.4. It definitely needs some major testing. So if you are having a test site and you want to check it out and yeah, please report back on what your findings are and if you tripped up by things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani</em>: So here in the PR, the example is log in logout, card and checkout, but it&#8217;ll be different for each plugin? For different plugins?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, so there&#8217;s an API where a plugin developer can say, &#8220;Okay, I want this content or this particular feature added to a columns block.&#8221; Or to a paragraph block. For instance, just an anchor link to every paragraph. You can write a plugin and say, &#8220;Okay, for each paragraph add this anchor link on the right-hand side.&#8221; And then a user can install that plugin and then automatically has that on their blog and can now reference certain paragraphs. So some people do blogging more like a diary where they have all the sorts of a day in little paragraphs or in a cluster of paragraphs and say, &#8220;Okay, today I wrote also about my adventure of riding the bike down the hill on a certain hill,&#8221; and then want to link to that through Twitter or through Instagram because there&#8217;s also a picture to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you can go back to the blog and read a little bit about it. So that&#8217;s one tiny use case. Another one is, as I said, the like button for comments. Normally comments don&#8217;t come with like buttons. But you can build a plugin that says, &#8220;Okay, every comment gets a like button for me and I want it at the top of it or on the bottom of it.&#8221; And that&#8217;s all in the API controls. And then when it&#8217;s installed and the user wants to use it can also say, &#8220;For this paragraph, I want to toggle in and off. I want to disable that particular added block for this particular paragraph. And then for the next block I want it again.&#8221; So it&#8217;s kind of a beginning of a new interface or a new way to customize the block editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Documentation</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of development, 6.3 brought a few pickups to the surface that with the&#8230; Enqueuing of assets in the editor and the CSS and Nick Diego updated the documentation and how to guide to and queue assets in the editor and best practice or how it&#8217;s actually supposed to work, especially now with the iFrame editor in the post editor as well. There were some early adopters of the block editor created a few workarounds, the early restrictions that were there. And now with 6.3 or the iFraming of the post editor, some of those don&#8217;t work anymore as one would hope. So here&#8217;s a how to guide on how to enqueue assets in the editor after 6.3.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani</em>: So this how to guide is targeted for developers? Or for everyone who wants to learn about Gutenberg in general can also try to learn this?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh yeah, sure, sure. It&#8217;s a website, so the website doesn&#8217;t know who&#8217;s coming in. So it&#8217;s on the developer&#8230; The link goes right now to the Gutenberg repo where the pages, but I will share the link in the show notes where the actual documentation page was created. So it&#8217;s in the realm of the other documentation of the block editor. Yeah, it&#8217;s definitely helpful when you start out thinking about your theme development or your plugin development and you have additional assets like JavaScript files, CSS files to go with those entities and how to do it to control your iFrame editor. There has also been an update on the block variations API, and that has been&#8230; Block variations have been around since the beginning of the block editor where you can modify in a core block that then add additional feature sets or styles or just kind of different behavior to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the block variations FPI had been updated, but this goes well with a new article on the developer blog called An Introduction to Block Variations where Nick Diego walks you through certain use cases on how to use it. So how to create a block variation, how to unregister. So you could use the block variation. So if a simple example is you have a button, you want the button to have a certain style, you can certainly do this through the theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you can also say, &#8220;Okay, I want to unregister the core button and I want my block variations for the core button to be the default.&#8221; So it shows up in the inserter as a core button, but it will always have the right color on the border or the background or the right font size that you have decided on the design of it. And the user doesn&#8217;t have to select between the two they just have one. Same could be with a code block or a verse block. You can really have quite a few methods and attributes that you can use to create those lock variations. Yeah, I learned quite a bit from the article.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani</em>: No, I just wanted to say that this resource is pretty comprehensive. We can learn many stuff about the block variations from the basic to the putting it all together and everything. We can check it here. So yeah, it&#8217;s great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, it also helps you how to control the icons for it or how the sidebar is behaving. So yes, it&#8217;s a really good article. All the articles on the developer blog, that&#8217;s actually a very rather new entity on the wordpress.org site. It only has been around for eight months, give or take. Official launch was actually March, so it&#8217;s only been around for five months officially, but we started in November with it. And there are quite a few blog posts now that are tutorials and go a little bit deeper on then documentation help you picks up the developer from a different place, from a beginner place and go all the way to advanced. Or say, &#8220;Okay, this is your use case.&#8221; There are a series of blog posts as well as standalone posts. And you can also learn about the slot fields. What&#8217;s slot fields? Well, it&#8217;s the spaces in the sidebar of a block where you can add additional features, fields and all that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the developer block is definitely something to check out if you are a developer and extending the block editor. And yeah, this concludes the change log for 16.6. We are through that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What’s in Active Development or Discussed</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>And as I said at the beginning, we also wanted to discuss a few things, or two things. No, actually three that are in active development. And the first one is a big feature that is announced slated for 6.4. The contributors have been working on it for quite a while, almost a whole year to get font management into WordPress. Meaning upload funds, make them available for blocks, make them available for templates, and then also delete funds, and have them across themes. So you are not depending on a theme developer to provide you with the right fonts. You can as a site owner also make different choices there. And I will share with you a link to a PR that kind of puts it all together, how it all works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And Jeffrey Pearce also just made a call for testing on Twitter where he provided a link to a WordPress playground site with the configuration to test this successfully already in place. Because you need to make changes to the WP-config file and then you need to enable the plugin for it, the experiment for it and all that. So there&#8217;s kind of a set-up manually to be done, but this link to the WordPress playground gives you the PR, or the version of Gutenberg that has the PR in it as well as the right setup. And then you can test it, you can upload fonts, you make them available through the interface. You can use them on pages, on posts and on templates and see if the font on front end and editor actually would display correctly. And anything that you find that&#8217;s not working right, report that back to the PR so they can go and fix it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once it&#8217;s merged, so right now the PRs are still in the works and a lot of people are testing it, but it could use some more testing. If you listen to this and the PR has already been merged, it will be available through the Gutenberg nightly plugin version that you get on the Gutenberg Times, and then you can start testing it on your normal, like any Gutenberg plugin version on your test site. And my favorite tool for testing is actually local WP from the WP Engine and Flywheel folks. That has been a tremendous help to go through all those testing. So font library is a big, big step forward for WordPress and any help you can give to testing it would be really appreciated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani:</em> So we can also use font library in playground?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: With the link that&#8230; The link is a Bitly link. It&#8217;s shortened because it&#8217;s actually 15 lines long. It&#8217;s bit.ly/text-font-library, and then it gives you a new WordPress site and then you can use it and test it. You cannot install other plugins there. You cannot install themes. So you would have to test it with the default theme Twenty Twenty Three. And the second part&#8230; It&#8217;s only two things, is a lot of people, especially content creators were really waiting for this, it&#8217;s the adding a background image to a group block. It&#8217;s coming, it&#8217;s already available in the Gutenberg nightly because the feature has already been merged with trunk. It&#8217;ll be released with 16.7 Gutenberg plugin. And if you can provide user feedback, that will be really great. And if the provided user feedback doesn&#8217;t reveal any big issues with that new feature, it will also arrive in WordPress 6.4 with the next upgrade on November 7th, 2023. How do you like that, Maya?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani</em>: I will definitely use this. I can see myself using this, I don&#8217;t know, for my company, for my day job, I don&#8217;t know about that. But so I have a website that is just to play around, my test site. I really like it. So I think I will definitely use this because it&#8217;s like, yeah, adding more creativity fuel to my toolkit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I can see that there are some very, very subtle backgrounds that could happen on different paragraphs, like wallpaper in a house or something like that where you can change that for a different group of posts or for&#8230; If you wrap a quote post into a group block, then you can add a background image to it, and that background image could have a photo of the person who gives the quote. So you don&#8217;t have to use backgrounds and fiddle around with all the blocks, you can just put it on the background image and then upload that to the quote block. And yeah, I really like it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we are at the end of the show. I just wanted to make sure people, when they want to connect with you, what would be a good place to meet you online, Maya?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani</em>: So I&#8217;m on Twitter and also I&#8217;m on Instagram. So yeah, I think I will&#8230; And on LinkedIn also, so in three places. So yeah, I will share the link to you so we can put it in the show notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Awesome. Awesome. Thank you so much. As always, the show notes will be published on Gutenbergtimes.com/podcast and this is the episode 89. And if you have questions, suggestions, or news that you want us to include, send them to <a href=\"mailto:changelog@gutenbergtimes.com\">changelog@gutenbergtimes.com</a>. That&#8217;s <a href=\"mailto:changelog@gutenbergtimes.com\">changelog@gutenbergtimes.com</a>. And there was a time when we had quite a few people add reviews about the podcast on different podcast websites like Stitcher or Apple or Google. It would be time to do another round of reviews. If you like what you hear and get value out of this podcast, please submit a review to Apple, that&#8217;s probably the most prominent one, to iTunes or podcast, and that would be really lovely. And as a bonus, we will read them in our next show. So yeah, come on then.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani</em>: Give a little shout-out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Give a little shout-out. Yeah. So Maya, thank you so much for joining me today. It was lovely to have you on the show and give your input and have opinions will travel that&#8217;s always beneficial at WordPress. Yeah, and I thank you all for listening and I&#8217;ll hear you in two weeks. We won&#8217;t have a 16.7 then, but we will have Tammy Lister on the show and we will talk about WordPress 6.4 and the whole process. And I wish you all well, take care and goodbye.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani</em>: Thank you, Birgit. Forget the pleasure is all mine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Thank you.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sun, 10 Sep 2023 08:35:38 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:19:\"Gutenberg Changelog\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:14;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:122:\"Gutenberg Times: Font Library call for testing, Gutenberg 16.6, OmniForm and WooCommerce Blocks 11.0—Weekend Edition 267\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/?p=25460\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:129:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/font-library-call-for-testing-gutenberg-16-6-omniform-and-woocommerce-blocks-11-0-weekend-edition-267/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:15030:\"<p>Howdy, </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/6-4/\">WordPress 6.4 release</a> is fast approaching.

We will do this by mentoring and supporting women to take the next step in their careers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>WP Includes is recruiting women leaders who are C-Level or Directors <br />at a WordPress company to volunteer as mentors and build a supportive network of mentees.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The mentorship program lasts five months and calls for mentees/mentors goes out twice a year in September and March. Mentors commit to meet with mentees for a 1:1 on a regular basis and support them in achieving their goals. Mentee applicants are required to be working at a business in the WordPress ecosystem and actively developing their careers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WP Includes is accepting sponsorships from companies with some rigorous requirements:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Acknowledge gender disparity and a lack of representation in your organization, wherever it exists.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Proactively address gender disparity in your leadership and executive roles.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>When senior roles become available, actively seek to place women within those roles.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Support women within their career in your organization, working to ensure that any gender-related barriers are removed.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Create opportunities to showcase women leaders in your organisation so that they can act as role models for future leaders.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Supporting organizations can also contribute by sharing open roles within the network and by providing mentorship to future leaders who may potentially be considered for leadership roles in the sponsoring organizations. This is effectively changing representation from the inside out with cooperating organizations contributing to the cultivation of the leaders they need in order to purse more diverse leadership teams.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prospective mentees, mentors, and sponsors can apply on the <a href=\"https://wpincludes.me/\">WP Includes website</a>. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 09 Sep 2023 02:31:25 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:17;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:114:\"WPTavern: ACF’s 2023 Annual Survey Results Reinforce Plugin’s Focus on Improving the Block Building Experience\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=148573\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:119:\"https://wptavern.com/acfs-2023-annual-survey-results-reinforce-plugins-focus-on-improving-the-block-building-experience\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3017:\"<p>Advanced Custom Fields (<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/\">ACF</a>), one of the plugins WP Engine <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-engine-acquires-5-plugins-from-delicious-brains\">acquired from Delicious Brains</a> in 2022, has published the <a href=\"https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/annual-survey/2023-results/\">results if its first annual survey</a>. Although ACF reports more than 4.5 million active users, including PRO site installs, the survey only gathered feedback from 2,031 respondents. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>These results are more representative of the plugin&#8217;s developer community, as 81% of respondents are developers who maintain between 11-50 websites. 63% use version control for their codebase, and 27% manage dependencies with Composer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The survey showed that ACF is still an important tool for its early adopters, as 50% said they have been using it since its early days and 70% of all respondents use the plugin on all the websites they build.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When asked what type of sites they are building, respondents had the option to choose multiple answers. Sites using Classic WordPress themes are the most popular followed by Hybrid themes, Block themes, and page builders. Surveying those who use the block editor, 56% report that they build blocks using ACF blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1358\" height=\"1030\" src=\"https://149611589.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screen-Shot-2023-09-08-at-10.35.34-AM.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-148627\" />\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It was cool to see the strong representation of hybrid and block themes,&#8221; WP Engine Product Marketing Manager Rob Stinson said. &#8220;It shows us that there is growing adoption of the modern WP editor experience amongst the PHP friendly crowd that is the ACF user base. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We had this scoped for upcoming releases anyway, but it reinforces our focus on improving the block building experience in ACF.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Among those ACF users building sites with page builders, the most popular selections include Elementor, Divi, Beaver Builder, and WPBakery Page Builder.  Naturally, ACF Extended is the most popular extension used with ACF, followed by Gravity Forms, Yoast SEO, and ACF Better Search.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"2110\" height=\"1168\" src=\"https://149611589.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screen-Shot-2023-09-08-at-12.46.15-PM.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-148636\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Respondents demonstrated high confidence in those maintaining the plugin, as 98% of them are comfortable updating ACF to the latest version. They are also confident in continuing to build on top of WordPress, as 91% of survey participants said they are likely to continue with the platform.

Users can then reposition the blocks after insertion using the editor tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenberg lead architect Matias Ventura <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/53987#issuecomment-1695915874\">proposed</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/54147\">renaming</a> the feature to block hooks to help developers understand how they work. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve seen anecdotal feedback that <code>autoInsert</code> is not the clearest of descriptions,&#8221; Ventura said. &#8220;I&#8217;d like to propose renaming to the more familiar <code>hooks</code> terminology—and &#8216;block hooks&#8217; in more general terms—to help folks understand the mechanics and purpose more rapidly.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This release also <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/52969\">adds an inspector panel for block hooks</a>, tentatively named &#8220;Plugins,&#8221; that displays blocks available for auto-insertion. It includes toggles to insert or remove them. The updated version of the feature also includes block icons (not shown below) to help differentiate the toggles. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1443\" height=\"438\" src=\"https://149611589.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/block-hooks.gif\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-148604\" />image source: <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/52969#issuecomment-1669889491\">Gutenberg repository PR #52969</a>\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenberg 16.6 brings improvements to toolbars on nested blocks, where the toolbar now stays attached to the parent block. This change is part of a broader effort to improve nested block experiences. Previously, the toolbar would move around when clicking inside the nested blocks, but this change makes it stay in place for a less chaotic editing experience. The updated toolbar behavior has been rolled out to Navigation, List, and Quote blocks so far.</p>\n\n\n\nvideo credit: Gutenberg GitHub repository <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/53699\">PR #53699</a>\n\n\n\n<p>This release includes a new keyboard shortcut for duplicating blocks within the List View: (<code>CMD+Shift+d</code>). It enables users to do more from the keyboard while navigating around the List View, instead of having to jump back into the block settings menu or editor canvas. Users can now click twice on the selected (or focused) block or multiple blocks to quickly duplicate them all in one go.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\nvideo credit: Gutenberg GitHub repository <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/53559\">PR #53559</a>\n\n\n\n<p>These highlighted features and more will be landing in the upcoming WordPress 6.4 release.

My name is Nathan Wrigley.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jukebox is a podcast which is dedicated to all things WordPress. The people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case, why the time might be right for the Fields API.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast player of choice. Or by going to WPTavern.com forward slash feed forward slash podcast. And you can copy that URL into most podcast players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast, I&#8217;m keen to hear from you, and hopefully get you all your idea featured on the show. Head to WPTavern.com forward slash contact forward slash jukebox. And use the form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today, we have Scott Kingsley, Clark.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scott is a WordPress developer who has been working with WordPress since 2007. He&#8217;s well-known for his work on the Pods Framework, a popular content and custom fields plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scott&#8217;s goal is to find ways to enhance the WordPress experience, particularly in terms of working with different types of data. He&#8217;s currently involved in the WordPress Fields API project, which aims to provide a better solution for developers looking to wrangle their data. And that is the focus of the podcast today. As you&#8217;ll hear, Scott is determined to contribute to the continual growth and improvement of WordPress, and to make the Fields API a reality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scott came from a background using Drupal, which is an alternative CMS. When he first ventured into WordPress, he found certain features were lacking. Things which were baked into Drupal Core were not available in WordPress, a notable example being custom fields.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We know that WordPress has a myriad of plugins, which can take on the burden of creating custom fields, but Scott has concerns about the interoperability of these plugins, and he wants to create a more solid structure within WordPress itself. Wouldn&#8217;t it be nice if there were ways for developers to create custom field plugins so that you weren&#8217;t locked into one or the other. Scott imagines a future in which you could move from ACF, Metabox Toolset and more. A future built on top of the Fields API.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout the conversation, scott talks about his passion for incorporating the block editor, React and other technologies into WordPress. He shares insights on controlling block settings, making them extensible through PHP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might know Scott from his work on the popular Pods Framework plugin. This plugin allows users to create custom content types and fields in WordPress, and certainly speaks to his credentials in trying to push the Fields API project forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We talk about what the Fields API might become. The aim is to simplify the process of working with custom fields and content types in WordPress. With the Fields API, Scott hopes to unify the different methods and APIs for managing custom fields, making it easier for developers and non-developers alike to add their fields to different screens within WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a complicated undertaking and we get into some of the areas of WordPress, which might benefit from his work. Scott sheds light on the challenges faced during the development of the Fields API, the need for shared storage standards among plugins, and the potential for better integration with the WordPress Admin UI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Towards the end of the podcast we talk about the future of the Fields API project, and how gaining support from people in the WordPress community will be crucial to its success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in how WordPress can be used as a fully featured CMS, this podcast is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to find out more, you can find all of the links in the show notes by heading to WPTavern.com forward slash podcast, where you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so without further delay, I bring you Scott Kingsley Clark.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast today by Scott Kingsley Clark. Hello Scott.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:53] <strong>Scott Kingsley Clark:</strong> Hey Nathan, how&#8217;s it going?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:55] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah really good. Thank you for joining us on the podcast today. We&#8217;re going to get into the weeds a little bit with WordPress code and all sorts of things. We haven&#8217;t had one of these episodes for a little while so this will be nice and refreshing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scott, given that we&#8217;re going to be talking about something technical I suppose it would be a good thing right at the beginning to learn about your technical expertise. The various different projects that you&#8217;ve touched in the WordPress space during the time that you&#8217;ve been in that. So just yeah a little moment for you to offer up your bio really. So over to you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:24] <strong>Scott Kingsley Clark:</strong> Well sure. I started working with WordPress in about 2007 or 8. I used it briefly once before with a one click install from cPanel before that, but I didn&#8217;t really like it at the time. And I was doing many other things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But ever since that point I have been really involved with trying to make WordPress the best that it can be. And that has evolved through plugin development. One of the plugins I&#8217;m more known for is the Pods Framework. And that is a content type, a custom field plugin for WordPress. But I&#8217;ve also tried to find ways to make it easier for other developers to build things without needing a plugin. Because a plugin like Pods existed before custom post types had a real API.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But now that it has a real API you don&#8217;t really need a plugin like Pods to just make a custom post type. And the goal for me is, I&#8217;d love to see a better way to work with those types of objects inside of WordPress that have very different APIs, or in some cases no API at all. You just have to output your own markup and hook into some hooks. And it&#8217;s not really great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Especially in this day where we have everything exposed to the Rest APIs. And you want to build really cool blocks, but you can&#8217;t leverage some data from different structures that don&#8217;t exist. So that&#8217;s where I&#8217;d love to find ways for WordPress to level up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this particular project of mine, is the WordPress Fields API. There is a group of us who have kind of rebooted it, but it existed in 2000 and, I want to say 14, 15, 16, 2017, all through those years. And we had made some progress, made a few different proposals and it just got stuck up in the process of getting the block editor and Rest API.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there was just so many more bigger features that were getting the priority, and it kind of burned me out. And I didn&#8217;t find anyone else to carry the torch so it just went away. And just the start of this year we started up again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:30] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> What was the reason that it went away? You mentioned there that there were a whole variety of different things going on at the same time. So was it that the community&#8217;s focus just seemed to be more interested on other things? And so despite the fact that you were putting in the time, and you obviously just described that it burnt you out a little bit. There just wasn&#8217;t enough interest because attention was being put elsewhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:53] <strong>Scott Kingsley Clark:</strong> Right. Well Fields API owes so much to WebDevStudios and 10up who offered a lot of my time on the clock. They donated my time towards developing the Fields API and pushing it forward. And at 10up we were really, really close. We got the closest we had been at that point because at 10up we had a really awesome contributor for WordPress. A core committer, Helen Hou-Sandi.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that got us really close, but I think it just was that I was practically speaking for Fields API and saying, we should do this, we should do that, and it just wasn&#8217;t hitting. It wasn&#8217;t hitting right for them. Or the people who were involved in making decisions on what was going to make it, or what was going to get the attention or whatever, just didn&#8217;t feel it yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I can understand that. I mean there&#8217;s so much that everyone is trying to do for each release. And I kind of assumed that if I built as much as possible and showed it as a really thoroughly working prototype with tests and everything else. And I just handed it to them and said hey here it is. Can you help me make this part of WordPress Core? Do you have any feedback? And when I did that I guess the biggest problem was I hadn&#8217;t really involved all those same voices at that point prior to actually doing the development of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I had some input from a few different core contributors and committers and such. But as soon as I pushed out that final proposal in 2017 we got so many detractors and people saying, oh we should have done this differently or, why is it like this? And I would have done it this way. And it kind of did not get the consensus that I was needing for it to gain further traction. So we&#8217;ve kind of approached it differently in this reboot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:42] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay, right. So you did a lot of the work, you put it out there but the feedback that came back didn&#8217;t exactly encourage you, let&#8217;s put it that way. There were people who just would rather it had been done in their way. I&#8217;m guessing that that&#8217;s because there are loads of different ways that this type of problem has been tackled I guess on a more or less on a per plugin basis. There&#8217;s probably hundreds of plugins out there that do something similar. They do it their way. And so they presumably think that their way is the way that it should be done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:15] <strong>Scott Kingsley Clark:</strong> Right. I mean there&#8217;s so many plugins like ACF and Pods and Toolset, so many more at comparewp.org slash cck. Which is like a really cool comparison list of all these different types of plugins. But there&#8217;s so many that each one has their own baked in API for managing fields in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s just bonkers that everyone has to build all these APIs, and in the end they&#8217;re almost it&#8217;s forcing the need of having to build their own APIs because they won&#8217;t accept anything else other than the one that they built. And I think that it&#8217;s tricky with developers and egos and everything else. We all have to kind of find a way to, you know, what is the minimum bare essentials API that we could build for this and find a consensus on that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:01] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So I guess this time around the community involvement is going to be there. You&#8217;re going to do this much more in the open. So that as you are going along presumably ideas are chipped in, rather than it just being one great big release at the end where everybody gets to either agree or disagree.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:18] <strong>Scott Kingsley Clark:</strong> Right yeah. We tried to do that before but I think the challenge was we moved so quickly. I built so much code and I had made a specification ahead of time. But really the time wasn&#8217;t spent in the research specification side to get a consensus at that point, with not just the people who were involved but everyone else. Making sure everyone else had a moment to do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I guess when people just look at a specification like oh, I&#8217;ll just look at it later on when he has something for me to look at. And so it just gets delayed. And I&#8217;m hoping that this time I can find ways to intuitively make it so people will actively and proactively be part of that process and give feedback</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:01] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So given that you&#8217;ve restarted it, what reinvigorated it for you? Where did your curiosity for something that has been dormant for quite a number of years now. What on earth was it that brought you back to seeing this as a worthwhile use of your time?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:16] <strong>Scott Kingsley Clark:</strong> Since 2017 I&#8217;ve had kind of dark years in my contributing to WordPress Core, and just feeling like, well I can&#8217;t get anything big done so maybe I shouldn&#8217;t spend my time on it. And just the amount of time I&#8217;d spent on it had taken away from my full time work and my side projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m just like, well if I&#8217;m going to do this I really need it to be something I believe in. And up until the start of the year I just didn&#8217;t really feel like it was going to be possible. And then Joe Dolson, from the accessibility team was talking about how their team was looking at trying to revitalize the settings screens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And one of the biggest challenges were their setting screens are hard coded in a lot of ways. And there&#8217;s not really an easy way to just like, here let&#8217;s try out this different interface. Let&#8217;s try this interface, this markup. We&#8217;ll change this markup here. And it&#8217;s very difficult to produce different markup inside of WordPress Core right now for a lot of screens really.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And more importantly for them, it&#8217;s not even using the Settings API the same way as most people are building things with the Settings API. And they hooked up with me because Courtney Robertson, a really awesome Dev Rel person, has just connected me with Joe at the end of last year I believe. And we just started talking about it, like hey this would be really cool if we had this Fields API stuff that you were thinking about before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I was like well I don&#8217;t know. And then as they discussed it with really the focus on accessibility I was like, you know what accessibility is such a big priority to me that I think it kind of overrides my initial thoughts about well I don&#8217;t know if I can get this into Core. Because I thoroughly believe in spending more time on accessibility for lots of different plugins. Especially for WordPress Core and the block editor. And if I can help push that forward I feel like I&#8217;ve done something better with my time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And at that point I was like yeah I&#8217;m in. We&#8217;ll focus on the Settings API, just on that. And we&#8217;re not going to like build all the different screens and API prototype that we had done before. Until we get the Settings API, let&#8217;s focus all of our energy on doing that for the Settings API itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:26] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So that all kicked off again at the beginning of this year, 2023. And I&#8217;m staring at a page on the Make WordPress Core blog, which you wrote right at the beginning of the year, january the 9th. You&#8217;ve posted a video there of you, and I think the four other people on the call. So right at the very start of this year, five people involved at the very least.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How has the project been growing? Has it caught the attention in the way that you&#8217;d hoped? Have there been people coming along to assist? One of the enterprises of this podcast episode is obviously to swell the number of people, but it would be quite nice to know how it&#8217;s going just prior to that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:04] <strong>Scott Kingsley Clark:</strong> So as with a lot of these kinds of initiatives it all depends on the time you put in, as someone who has the vision and leads it. And my time on the Fields API had been kind of reduced, just right after this. The economy started having some challenges in the tech space, and job security was a concern in a lot of areas for a lot of people, especially me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I didn&#8217;t have as much free time to focus on that. I was focused on my work, keeping my head down and making sure I was doing all my things. And I just didn&#8217;t have enough headspace for it. But I knew that if I could really spend a great deal of time this summer on the Fields API, getting it prepared, getting it to the next phase, so that we have something solid. By the time it is time for Community Summit contributor day for WordCamp US we have a solid chance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then something came out of nowhere. On the Make WordPress dot org core, blog I saw a post come through. And I&#8217;ve been watching posts there all the time and sometimes I&#8217;ll provide feedback. But this one was unique. This one was talking about revamping the Admin UI. And now I&#8217;m getting all sorts of excited and I&#8217;m thinking to myself, oh this is my time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, if I can get the Admin UI perspective on the Fields API, I think this could even help us further, pushing this forward. Because if you want to approach redoing the Admin UI you have to expose these kinds of fields and forms and screens in a way that is more dynamic than it is right now. And that is a sweet spot for the Fields API.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I posted on that blog post. I asked Matias, hey can we have Fields API? Please, please, please be part of this conversation. I would love to talk to you more about it. And so we&#8217;re probably going to talk about it at WordCamp US, some time during that week. And my hope is we&#8217;ll get this really pushed further. Because it takes buy in from the vocal people in WordPress. And I think I&#8217;m beginning to see more buy in. And that is really a positive thing for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:12] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Sounds like a really nice bit of serendipity there. Couple of things happened, and the chance of the Admin UI being overhauled kind of sits perfectly doesn&#8217;t it. That really would be the moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is a dramatic change that&#8217;s being proposed. And so I guess if you&#8217;re going to go all in on changing the Admin UI, well now would be the time to get all of the fields work done as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It just occurs to me that given the audience that listen to this podcast, there&#8217;s a fair smattering of developers no doubt. But also there&#8217;s people who are just into WordPress. You know, it&#8217;s a hobby. They perhaps do it as a side gig or something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So maybe we should rewind and do some explanations about what on earth an API for fields would even do. Why is it even needed? I&#8217;m suspecting that many people log in to their WordPress website, certainly since the advent of Gutenberg. And more or less everything that they want to do, publish posts, schedule posts, that&#8217;s possibly the extent of it all. It functions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;m imagining there&#8217;s a proportion of people listening to this going, well, what even would this be needed for? Describe a scenario where this would be useful. So, let&#8217;s cover that out. What is the Fields API? How would it change what WordPress does?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:25] <strong>Scott Kingsley Clark:</strong> Sure. So let me preface my answer with, there&#8217;s a reason why there&#8217;s so many plugins out there doing content types and custom fields. There&#8217;s a reason why Advanced Custom Fields has millions of active installs. And tons of people have paid for the pro premium versions of these kinds of plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now I&#8217;ll get into the real answer. This is an incredibly complicated dance. Whenever you want to go add a custom field to a post, or let&#8217;s say you&#8217;re building a site, a hobby site. I use the book analogy a lot, but let&#8217;s talk about music, because I love music too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you&#8217;re setting up a site for your music and maybe you&#8217;re an artist, a solo artist or a band. And you&#8217;re trying to set up a list of albums. And so you&#8217;re like well, how do I add albums? You could add that in the block editor. No problem, no issues there. But then what if you wanted to make it more data oriented.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you wanted to do that you&#8217;d have to go register a custom post type for album, for instance. Maybe a custom post type for tracks, if you want to relate them to albums in some way. And maybe a custom post type for other things. Maybe custom taxonomies for other items that you want. But the challenge there is not really in the content type. It&#8217;s in the custom fields you want to add to that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inside of WordPress, I counted it up recently, there&#8217;s somewhere between 16 to 17 different APIs and hooks that are totally different from each other, to add custom fields or settings to different areas on all the different screens, and different objects inside of WordPress. That is a lot. So adding a custom field means you have to go add an action inside of PHP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First of all you have to know PHP and kind of know where to put it. Second of all you have to then go add action to add a meta box. Then you have to add your code to render all of your fields markup. So you have to add your HTML in there and have it do that. Then you have to add an action to handle the saving.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then at that point you&#8217;re probably going to be looking at doing more things for taxonomies possibly. So you have to work with another action there. You have to add things there and it doesn&#8217;t look great. So then you have to add more markup. And it&#8217;s a lot for someone who just wants to build.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you just mentioned that there&#8217;s a number of developers listening to this right now. But there&#8217;s a lot of people who aren&#8217;t really considering themselves developers. They&#8217;re just people building sites and they don&#8217;t really have time to dig into the code. Or they don&#8217;t want to tell their client they can do this if they can&#8217;t build it custom, they would have to pay someone else to do that. And they want to avoid that cost. So they&#8217;re going to use one of these off the shelf plugins, like Advanced Custom Fields.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why would you spend five hours building your albums and tracks and things like that in PHP? The trial and error and figuring out the markup and, why is this not working? And then coming back to it later on and spending another few hours trying to debug something that happens. And then displaying it all on the front end. Why spend all that time when you can just install a plugin and just click a few buttons? And boom, you have another post type and then you have your fields already displayed. And by the way they look really nice. Why would you spend that time?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this is more of a feature, or more of a project geared towards developers so that it makes them spend less time on their side of things. And it unifies all 16, 17 of these methods and APIs to work with all these different screens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what the end result would be is anyone using WordPress could then be using a plugin, or potentially use code snippets very easily without having to have a whole lot of knowledge. And be able to add a field to different screens without a whole lot of code, or whole lot of PHP experience. And these types of plugins like ACF, and Pods, and Toolset and various others, they could then leverage the Fields API if they&#8217;re supporting that WordPress version that includes it. They could leverage this Fields API in a way that reduces the code that they actually have to have inside their own plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And at the same time that makes it so WordPress itself, the REST APIs, everything that talks with the Fields API, then knows about the structures you&#8217;re registering.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a hand in hand, win-win scenario for end users who benefit from the stability, and the flexibility, and extensibility of those APIs in place. And developers who want to be able to utilize those things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:54] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Have you any experience with other CMSs? We could probably list off half a dozen or more other CMSs. But certainly some that I have used in the past, a lot of these kind of features are baked into the core product. So the ability to add custom fields to, well it may not be called a custom post type over on that particular platform but you get the idea. It is already built in, if you like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You mentioned that you want to have this pushed to Core. Do you see that other CMSs are potentially stealing a march on WordPress? WordPress has traditionally been very good at giving 80% of the people what they want. So there is some argument as to whether or not some things should be added or some shouldn&#8217;t. But do you feel its been lacking this? And really a lot of other rival CMSs have been doing this for years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:42] <strong>Scott Kingsley Clark:</strong> That&#8217;s a very good point. The plugin Pods was one of the first ones that did custom content types and custom fields for WordPress in a way that mimicked, and this is in 2008, the end of 2008. It mimicked Drupal at the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Drupal has a major feature called, what they called CCK, which was Content Construction Kit. I think that was what it was.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so what value that API had for Drupal was that it would let you do the kinds of things you&#8217;re seeing be possible with plugins like Metabox or whatever else, you can use code, and ACF to register your groups and fields, and you can use code to register custom post types.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you don&#8217;t have to use the UIs. You don&#8217;t have to provide a bunch of JSON. You can just register those things through PHP. And Drupal has had this for many, many years. It&#8217;s coming up on almost 20 years now that it&#8217;s had a feature like CCK. And that is not really that Drupal is ahead of WordPress, it&#8217;s that WordPress is severely behind. Because it hasn&#8217;t really prioritized these kinds of unifying APIs for its screens. I mean obviously WordPress hasn&#8217;t.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you look at it, it really hasn&#8217;t changed a whole lot until block editor. The interfaces and screens really kind of have been what they are. The structure of where things are has been mostly the same outside the block editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Multisite was a big thing, but the screens themselves they really haven&#8217;t changed a whole lot. And I think that is just because we&#8217;ve been focused as a project on building features and not looking back at what we&#8217;ve done, and finding a better way to represent that. A project like the Admin UI revamp, or even accessibility revamp, could give us that time to kind of be introspective. What are we doing with these screens, and how do we make these things better?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And backward compatibility doesn&#8217;t have to be a hindrance in the Fields API because it can be backward compatible too. It&#8217;s just if you want to register the new way you can do that and that is the officially the way that we recommend you do it. It&#8217;s just, it works. I really hope that more people see things like Drupal, and there&#8217;s so many other plugins, or so many other CMSs out there that have their own kind of CCK situations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because it&#8217;s just, you&#8217;re building a CMS? Well you&#8217;re not going to want to do that the way the WordPress did it way back when. No one&#8217;s going to want to do that on purpose. And I think that they all already have their own forms and Fields API processing abilities, because that&#8217;s the bare minimum. As a developer, when you&#8217;re building something like this you build that. You don&#8217;t build all the markup and everything hard coded anymore.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:24] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah I was a big fan of Drupal, and I used Drupal exclusively more or less for many years. My first interaction with WordPress was an endeavor to move away from Drupal for a variety of different reasons. And I do remember opening up WordPress and almost being incredulous that I couldn&#8217;t achieve some of the things that I was simply able to achieve with a vanilla install of Drupal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So custom fields was just trivially easy. It was there, it was baked in. And so I had this expectation, well everybody&#8217;s using WordPress it must have, you know, a similar feature set. And so, just flabbergasted that it didn&#8217;t exist.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course very quickly found out exactly what you just said. That commercial and also free, there&#8217;s plenty of free options as well, Pods being one. That you had to go and find a solution for that. So rather than it being baked into core you&#8217;d go out and you&#8217;d purchase ACF or you would download Pods or whatever it may be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But this sort of feeling that well that&#8217;s interesting because I wonder how they&#8217;re doing that and if they&#8217;re doing it differently than the other one, so if ACF is doing it differently to how Pods is doing it, you could make that spaghetti go in any direction. How am I going to be stuck in the future? You know things that I create with Pods, is that interoperable? Could I start using ACF at a future date on the same website?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there&#8217;s all of that thrown into it as well. And I guess the endeavor here is to create that basic structure so that everybody can approach it and everybody can start creating these things without the reliance necessarily on a third party plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:03] <strong>Scott Kingsley Clark:</strong> Right. Like if you&#8217;re using a plugin like that and the Fields API comes out, there could be a migration thing, or exporting plugin created that exports from Pods or ACF or whatever into the Fields API structure. Much like ACF and some of these other plugins have the ability to kind of export. Maybe the biggest one is Custom Post Type UI. Where it&#8217;s just simple. Add custom post types, you add custom taxonomies and you can export that to code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that code works without the plugin. So it just tells it, here is what you tell WordPress to do what you want to do here. That kind of ability to export into just a Fields API code would take your code, your plugin usage of ACF or Pods or whatever, and you could easily switch out into just pure WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also because if it has that ability to use the Fields API at that point you have more interoperability. So you can go between these different plugins more easily because there&#8217;s a similar structure we&#8217;re all using. And when you&#8217;re registering through Fields API you can potentially set like a source, like this is coming from ACF, or whatever you want.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then a Pods plugin could say oh hey I recognize you had these ACF fields, do you want to bring them over? The Fields API opens up the door because everyone&#8217;s talking the same talk. And we can all talk about things in the same conversation instead of like I need to know the ACF APIs to work with getting the fields out, and I need to know this and then that. And there&#8217;s that side.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there&#8217;s also the storage side. So we&#8217;re talking about the way that ACF stores their content. For repeatable fields that can be quite tricky. Flexible content, anything that has to do with data that&#8217;s not just a simple single value gets a little bit tricky depending on how you choose to store it in ACF.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So those sorts of things are more based off of the plugin developers preference. So ACF was developed in a specific kind of point of view, for how they should store the storage. Pods is the same way, we have a specific point of view where it should be stored a certain way. Every plugin will have their own points of view. But if we can settle on the structure of the content fields, the custom fields for each of these objects, and how they&#8217;re going to be specified to WordPress, that&#8217;s really half the battle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then we can start talking about, okay now that we have this common language let&#8217;s work on bringing everyone to the same storage, so anyone can switch between these different plugins and they won&#8217;t have to deal with any extra work. We could all agree on a shared set of storage, kind of specification standards really.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:35] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> The breadth of this project feels like it could be truly enormous because there are fields in all sorts of unexpected places in WordPress. I mean you may not be thinking about them all the time but you know we&#8217;ve got post types, and terms, and comments, and settings, and users, and navigation, and the media library and all sorts of different places.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How are you breaking it down? Is there an order in which you&#8217;re going to knock those dominoes over? Are you going for, I don&#8217;t know, probably the low hanging fruit of custom post types first, or is the intention to try and get everything done all at once? You did mention accessibility. Perhaps that&#8217;s come first because of Joe Dolson&#8217;s interactions with you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:17] <strong>Scott Kingsley Clark:</strong> Yeah. So accessibility is going to be the main driving point for us right now. So we&#8217;re focused on the Settings API. If we can get this right and potentially the goal is to get it to the point where we can actually merge it just for the Settings API. Just for the Settings API.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have an inside person now, inside of WordPress itself. So now we can start expanding it, and say okay now here&#8217;s the proposal to add this to the post types, and to the terms and everywhere else to be powered by the Fields API. And once you have those things powered by the Fields API, the full Admin UI revamp is becoming much more approachable for people who want to switch out the markup there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They don&#8217;t have to modify core as much to make it happen. They don&#8217;t have to duplicate all the code and deal with merge conflicts. It&#8217;s just so much more easier when you&#8217;re working with data structures that are defined as data structures, and not purely as markup and save handlers like they are in many areas of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:13] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You&#8217;ve been doing this kind of work for years with Pods. So you know you&#8217;re incredibly familiar with this. Is there anything during your time working with Pods where you thought, I wish WordPress had this?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;m just wondering if you might try to smuggle into this some unique new feature, not something which we&#8217;re already familiar with. You know post types and comments and users. Really that question might go nowhere but I just wondered if there was something innovative that you&#8217;ve got. Really I&#8217;d love to try this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:40] <strong>Scott Kingsley Clark:</strong> So I do have something but it&#8217;s going to be interesting to see if we can make it happen. So the way that this has been focused on has been replacing existing screens that are kind of hard coded and all that. But we haven&#8217;t really talked about, what about the block editor? What about React and all those things?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the cool part about that is that if you look at the screen, if you go to the block editor right now, you&#8217;re looking at editing a post and you insert a block, like let&#8217;s talk about the paragraph block or even a group block. On the right hand side, if you have it open, the inspector control sidebar there. That allows you to control what the block settings are, on margins and adding extra classes if you want to add them to the block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And many different blocks have many different settings. And then also you can click over and if you&#8217;re looking at the post type, or page post type you&#8217;ll see the word post or page up there and there&#8217;s a little kind of a tab, and you click that and then you are looking at the object controls.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this controls what is going on with the page or post like attributes for the parent, or maybe the date, or the many different things like slug and all that. So both of these areas are areas I would love, not really to sneak in, but I want to get buy in from people. I want to find a way to build these screens, these sets of fields and have them extensible through PHP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we can do this in a way with the Fields API where you could register new sections and controls inside of React, it&#8217;s possible. We&#8217;re doing this right now. Pods is doing this, ACF, many other block builders are doing this with their blocks, their own blocks APIs. The way that we&#8217;re doing it right now is too much. It&#8217;s going down the same road of we&#8217;re locking ourselves in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I want these sections and these controls to be extensible. I want someone to be able to override stuff. I want someone to be able to add new things to them. I want to add something ahead of it or after it. I don&#8217;t want to have to know any JavaScript to be able to do the bare minimum for basic controls.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can still, with the Fields API even, you could still at that point do all the JavaScript or React stuff you want to build up your own custom controls, and the ways that you want them to display, and special handling for how to work with the blocks and all that. But really the bare minimum ought to be the way that we lower the bar towards developers, new people, new developers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But especially at this point, PHP is not getting the love it needs as an API source for WordPress, especially with a block editor. We need to expand that. I think there&#8217;s so much potential.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:27] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Given everything that you&#8217;ve just said, and we&#8217;ve now got a real nice full round picture of what it is that you&#8217;re trying to achieve, are there any significant roadblocks? I mean obviously hours and coding, the amount of time that it&#8217;s going to take you to do all these things, and the amount of people who jump on board the project, that&#8217;s a given. Are there any technical obstacles that are in the way that you foresee being problematic?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:52] <strong>Scott Kingsley Clark:</strong> So before, when we built all this stuff in the earlier versions, and I just read, we actually started working on the kind of Fields API idea in 2013. That&#8217;s even earlier than I remember. That was back in Freenode, Freenode IRC stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think one of the challenges was when we built all the different screens we had to modify WordPress Core files and override them. And as new versions of WordPress would be released we&#8217;d have to merge those changes into ours. It&#8217;s a headache to keep it up, and keep it updated for every release. And for even maintenance releases to make sure that you&#8217;re not breaking something that was changed or fixed inside of WordPress release, and having it so that my prototype should always work with latest WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well that&#8217;s difficult because latest WordPress is always changing. I think that&#8217;s the challenge is trying to focus not on, like we did before, we had posts, we had terms, we had settings, we had users, we had comments, we had media, we had the customizer. All those different areas were covered.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We already had those things covered inside of the Fields API code we had before. You could use the Fields API actively to add things to those screens. But that was a lot. That was a lot to deal with. So if we focus on settings, that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m hoping this reduced focus on setting screens will reduce the amount of pain we have to deal with. Because when we&#8217;re merging things we only have to worry about just those settings screens that we&#8217;re overriding for WordPress Core. That&#8217;s it. And we don&#8217;t have to worry about all the different screens and all the different files that we&#8217;ve been overriding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:16] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah thank you for that. I mean obviously you would be very warmly welcoming anybody who has listened to this and is intrigued by what you&#8217;ve said and thinks, okay I&#8217;ve got some technical expertise that I could apply to this project. If that&#8217;s the case, where are you hanging out most with this? I&#8217;m guessing the Slack channel is probably a good place to start. But maybe there&#8217;s some other places too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:39] <strong>Scott Kingsley Clark:</strong> I really deeply would love to have more contributors. Anyone who can think about things in different points of view for how a Fields API should be built. Things like someone who&#8217;s involved with other plugins that do this type of thing. It&#8217;s a big plus if you&#8217;ve built a Fields API yourself for one of these plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s also a big thing to think about you know just someone who&#8217;s not been building those things but maybe someone coming from outside of WordPress, or someone with heavier PHP structure experience. How do we structure the Fields API? And how is that going to look?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s also plenty of room for people who can help write tutorials, or help us write. I think one of my big deficiencies is having time to write up all the great text that we&#8217;re going to need for make.wordpress.org core posts about how do we describe what we&#8217;re building here, and get people involved and excited?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What is the proposal going to look like? And how do we lay this out nicely? And those types of things would be also very helpful to have. And you can find all of our efforts inside of Slack right now. So if you go into the WordPress Slack you&#8217;ll find us in the core dash fields channel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also have a GitHub that has been totally revamped from the old ones. We now have two different archive repos from the past versions that we had. And now we have this third repo that we&#8217;re using that is refreshed and ready to go. It already has some more research already in it and we&#8217;re going to start working from that repo now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:03] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That&#8217;s perfect. I will make sure to link to those in the show notes. Everything that you&#8217;ve mentioned I&#8217;ll make sure that it gets a link. But it sounds like not just technical people. There&#8217;s also room for people who have skills in, I don&#8217;t know, documentation or something that you&#8217;ve described. So the door is wide open. This feels like really important work. It would be lovely to get this over the wire. To get some more buy in, and more thoughts from different community members.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So yeah we&#8217;ll round it off there. Scott Kingsley Clark. Thank you so much for chatting to me today. I wish you all the best in getting this into Core in the, well, let&#8217;s say near future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:35] <strong>Scott Kingsley Clark:</strong> I really appreciate you including me and this project in your efforts here to get the word out. I can&#8217;t say how much I&#8217;m excited. I&#8217;m just extremely excited to get this finally pushed up and hopefully emerged into Core. And I am working my behind off this entire month, just to make sure that we can try to get that traction and get it across that finish line.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:58] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Well very much appreciated, because everything that you do and achieve will certainly make our WordPress lives a lot better. So thank you, Scott. I really appreciate it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:40:07] <strong>Scott Kingsley Clark:</strong> No problem.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have <a href=\"https://www.scottkclark.com/\">Scott Kingsley Clark</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scott is a WordPress developer who has been working with WordPress since 2007. He is well-known for his work on the <a href=\"https://pods.io/\">Pods Framework</a>, a popular content and custom fields plugin. Scott&#8217;s goal is to find ways to enhance the WordPress experience, particularly in terms of working with different types of data. He is currently involved in the WordPress Fields API project, which aims to provide a better solution for developers looking to wrangle their data, and that is the focus of the podcast today. As you’ll hear Scott is determined to contribute to the continual growth and improvement of WordPress and try to make the Fields API a reality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scott came from a background using Drupal, which is an alternative CMS. When he first ventured into WordPress, he found certain features were lacking. Things which were baked into Drupal Core were not available in WordPress, a notable example being custom fields.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We know that WordPress has a myriad of plugins which can take on the burden of creating custom fields, but Scott has concerns about the interoperability of these plugins, and he wants to create a more solid structure within WordPress itself. Wouldn’t it be nice if there were ways for developers to create custom field plugins so that you weren’t locked into one or the other? Scott imagines a future in which you could move from ACF, Metabox, Toolset and more; a future built on top of the Fields API.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout the conversation, Scott talks about his passion for incorporating the block editor, React, and other technologies into WordPress. He shares insights on controlling block settings, making them extensible through PHP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might know Scott from his work on the popular Pods Framework plugin. This plugin allows users to create custom content types and fields in WordPress, and certainly speaks to his credentials in trying to push the Fields API project forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We talk about what the Fields API might become. The aim is to simplify the process of working with custom fields and content types in WordPress. With the Fields API, Scott hopes to unify the different methods and APIs for managing custom fields, making it easier for developers and non-developers alike to add fields to different screens within WordPress. It’s a complicated undertaking and we get into some of the areas of WordPress which might benefit from this work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scott sheds light on the challenges faced during the development of Fields API, the need for shared storage standards among plugins, and the potential for better integration with the WordPress Admin UI.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Towards the end of the podcast we talk about the future of the Fields API project and how gaining support from people in the WordPress community will be crucial to its success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re interested in how WordPress can be used as a fully featured CMS, this podcast is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Useful links.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://pods.io/\">Pods Framework</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/\">REST API documentation</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mSqienVYxLopTFGLPK0lGCJst2knKzXDtLQRgwjeBN8/edit#gid=3\">Compare WP &#8211; Plugin Comparison &#8211; Content Types / Custom Fields</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://communitysummit.wordcamp.org/2023/\">WordPress Community Summit 2023</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/\">ACF</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/meta-box/\">Meta Box</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://toolset.com/\">Toolset</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-post-type-ui/\">Custom Post Type UI</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 15:10:32 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Nathan Wrigley\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:24;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:62:\"Akismet: 25 Ways to Increase Your Online Form Conversion Rates\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://akismet.com/?p=236608\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:46:\"https://akismet.com/blog/form-conversion-rate/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:23794:\"<p>Running a successful website is no small feat. It requires a great deal of hard work, dedication, and knowledge from a team of experts all working symbiotically toward a common goal. There are so many different aspects to consider — from designing the perfect user experience to maintaining an effective web hosting infrastructure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But one of the most critical aspects that can make or break success is the conversion rate of your forms. Your form conversion rate is the percentage of visitors who successfully complete a form on your website. The higher this rate, the more successful your site will be at generating new leads, sales, and other desired outcomes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether it&#8217;s a contact form, a <a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/how-to-enable-or-disable-user-registration-in-wordpress/\">sign-up form</a>, or a checkout form, the ease and convenience of these for users directly impact business.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s why, today, we&#8217;ll explore 25 ways to increase your online form conversion rates and, in turn, boost the effectiveness of your website.</p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-236608\"></span>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Keep forms short and simple</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The first rule of thumb, when it comes to increasing your form conversion rate, is to keep your forms short and simple. The less time and effort it takes for a user to complete a form, the more likely they are to do so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://contentsquare.com/insights/digital-experience-benchmark/\">Contentsquare 2023 Digital Experience Benchmark report</a>, the average internet user spends less than 5.6 minutes on a website they&#8217;re actively engaged with. Think reading a blog post or trying to make a purchase.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At first glance, that seems like a decent amount of time, but when you consider session duration has <a href=\"https://contentsquare.com/blog/average-time-spent-on-websites-is-dropping/\">decreased by 7.5%</a> since 2021, it&#8217;s clear that user behavior indicates less patience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s not a lot of time to capture their attention and get them to fill out a form. By keeping your forms short and straightforward, you&#8217;re making it as easy as possible for users to engage with your site and, ultimately, convert.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2023/08/image4.png\" alt=\"example of email list signup for WooCommerce\" class=\"wp-image-236610\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Consider only asking for the most essential information. If you&#8217;re collecting leads from potential event sponsors, you really only need the representative&#8217;s name and email. Your sales team may also want you to ask for a phone number, company name, and budget information, but each of these questions will reduce the number of top-of-funnel submissions you receive. So, you’ll have to consider this balance and optimize your forms accordingly.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Place your forms above the fold</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Above the fold&#8221; is a term borrowed from the newspaper industry that refers to the upper half of the front page. The term &#8220;above the fold&#8221; in web design is the part of a webpage that’s visible without the need to scroll. Placing your lead generation forms above the fold on their landing page makes them immediately visible to visitors, increasing the likelihood that they&#8217;ll be filled out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.nngroup.com/articles/scrolling-and-attention/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">study by Nielsen Norman Group</a> found that user attention drops dramatically below the fold. By placing your form above, you&#8217;re ensuring that it&#8217;s one of the first things a user sees when they land on your page.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The goal is to make it as easy as possible for people to convert. By strategically placing your web forms, you&#8217;re removing one more barrier between the user and a conversion.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Limit the use of CAPTCHAs</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>CAPTCHAs, those little tests that ask you to identify traffic lights or crosswalks in a series of images, are a common method of <a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/how-to-stop-contact-form-spam-on-wordpress/\">preventing form spam</a>. However, they can also be a significant barrier to web form completion.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2023/08/image10.png\" alt=\"example of a CAPTCHA with red spheres\" class=\"wp-image-236611\" />\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/wordpress-captcha/\">CAPTCHAs</a> can be frustrating and time-consuming for users, especially if they&#8217;re difficult to solve. And they can also pose accessibility issues for those with impairments. While CAPTCHAs can be effective at preventing bots from submitting forms, they can also deter legitimate users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of relying on CAPTCHAs, consider other methods of spam prevention that are less intrusive and more user-friendly…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Use non-intrusive spam protection</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Non-intrusive spam protection methods can be a great alternative to CAPTCHAs. These methods work behind the scenes to prevent spam without disrupting the user&#8217;s experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, the <a href=\"https://akismet.com/features/\">Akismet anti-spam plugin</a> for WordPress sites offers powerful spam protection without the need for CAPTCHAs. It automatically checks and filters out <a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/how-to-stop-contact-form-spam-on-wordpress/\">spam submissions</a>, allowing you to focus on managing your site.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2023/08/image1.png\" alt=\"Akismet homepage\" class=\"wp-image-236612\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Through prioritizing non-intrusive spam protection methods, you can improve the user experience and accessibility of your forms, leading to higher conversion rates.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Group related fields together</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Organization is key when it comes to designing user-friendly forms. Grouping related fields together can make your forms easier to navigate and understand, leading to higher completion rates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might wish to group contact information fields (like name, email, and phone number) together, separate from billing information fields (like credit card number, expiration date, and CVV).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This not only makes your form more visually organized, but it also helps users understand what kind of information is expected in each section.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6. Use clear and descriptive field labels</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Clear and descriptive field labels are crucial for ensuring that people know exactly what information they need to provide. Ambiguous or confusing labels can lead to errors, frustration, and ultimately, form abandonment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, if you&#8217;re asking for a user&#8217;s phone number, specify whether it&#8217;s a home, work, or mobile number.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re asking for a date, indicate the format you want it in (e.g., MM/DD/YYYY).</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2023/08/image3.png\" alt=\"name, email, and date fields grouped together\" class=\"wp-image-236613\" />\n\n\n\n<p>The goal is to make it as easy as possible for users to complete your form. Clear, descriptive labels go a long way towards achieving this and improving your form conversions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">7. Optimize for mobile devices</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With more than <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/277125/share-of-website-traffic-coming-from-mobile-devices/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">half of all web traffic</a> now coming from mobile devices, it&#8217;s more important than ever to ensure your forms are mobile-friendly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This means performing a series of form optimization tasks, including:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Making sure your web forms are fully responsive and easy to navigate on smaller screens</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ensuring fields are large enough to tap</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Making it easy for users to switch between fields</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Avoiding the use of elements that don&#8217;t work well on mobile, like hover tooltips.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Mobile users are on the go, so they are even less patient than desktop users. By optimizing your forms for mobile, you can make it easier for users to convert and boost your conversion rate.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">8. Use progress indicators</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If your form is long or divided into multiple sections, using progress indicators can be a great way to keep site visitors engaged. Progress indicators show people how far they&#8217;ve come and how much further they have to go to complete the form.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2023/08/image6.png\" alt=\"form with a progress bar\" class=\"wp-image-236614\" />\n\n\n\n<p>This can be particularly useful for complex forms, like multistep checkout processes or lengthy surveys. When you show users their progress, you&#8217;re giving them a sense of accomplishment and encouraging them to go all the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">9. Use autofill and auto-suggest features</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Autofill and auto-suggest features can significantly speed up the form completion process and improve the user experience. These features automatically populate fields with relevant information, saving users time and effort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, an autofill feature might populate a user&#8217;s address based on their IP location, while an auto-suggest feature might suggest relevant options as someone begins typing into a field.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you reduce the amount of typing and decision-making required, these features can make your forms quicker and easier to complete, leading to higher conversion rates.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">10. Use inline validation</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Inline validation involves checking each field for errors as the user fills out the form, rather than waiting until they hit the &#8220;submit&#8221; button. If a user makes a mistake, they&#8217;re immediately alerted and can correct the error on the spot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This can prevent frustration and confusion that can occur when a user completes a form, only to be told they&#8217;ve made multiple errors. It also helps users learn as they go, improving the overall experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">11. Use conditional logic</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Conditional logic, also known as &#8220;if-this-then-that&#8221; logic, can make your forms more interactive and user-friendly. It involves showing or hiding fields based on the user&#8217;s previous responses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, if someone indicates that they&#8217;re from the United States, you might show a field asking for their state. If they indicate they&#8217;re from another country, that field would be hidden.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By tailoring your form to each user&#8217;s responses, you can make the form-filling process more relevant and less overwhelming, leading to higher conversion rates.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">12. Limit the use of mandatory fields</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While it&#8217;s important to gather as much relevant information as possible, too many form fields can deter people from completing your form. Try to make fewer form fields mandatory and only require the most essential information.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If a field isn&#8217;t absolutely necessary, consider making it optional. Users who are in a hurry or who value their privacy will appreciate the option to skip non-essential fields.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">13. Use smart defaults</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Smart defaults involve pre-populating form fields with the most likely response. This can save users time and effort, making your form quicker and easier to complete.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if most of your site visitors are from the United States, you might set &#8220;United States&#8221; as the default option in the &#8220;Country&#8221; field. Users from other countries can still select their country from the dropdown menu, but U.S. users won&#8217;t have to.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">14. Break long forms into multiple pages</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Long forms can be overwhelming and may deter users from starting. By breaking these forms into smaller, more manageable steps, you can make the form-filling process less daunting and more user-friendly.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2023/08/image2.png\" alt=\"Page 2 of a multi-step form\" class=\"wp-image-236615\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Multipage forms also give users a sense of progress, which can motivate them to complete the form. Just remember to include a progress indicator, as we already mentioned, so users know how far they&#8217;ve come and how much further they have to go.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">15. Ensure accessibility for all users</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Accessibility should be a priority when designing your forms. This means ensuring that all users, including those with impairments or disabilities, can easily navigate and complete your web forms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This might involve using larger text sizes, providing alternative text for images, and ensuring your forms are compatible with screen readers. The <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/\">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</a> offers all the details about making web content more accessible.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2023/08/image5.png\" alt=\"W3C homepage\" class=\"wp-image-236616\" />\n\n\n\n<p>By making your forms accessible, you&#8217;re not only complying with legal requirements and ethical best practices, but you&#8217;re also expanding your user base and increasing your potential conversion rates.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">16. Use contrasting colors and clear typography</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The design of your forms can have a significant impact on their usability and, consequently, your conversion rates. Using contrasting colors can make your forms more visually appealing and easier to read.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, clear typography can improve readability and reduce the likelihood of errors. Choose fonts that are easy to read and large enough to be seen on all devices.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">17. Eliminate unnecessary distractions</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When a user is filling out a form, you want their focus to be on the form and nothing else. This means eliminating any unnecessary distractions, like pop-ups, excessive text, or irrelevant images.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The simpler and more focused your form page is, the more likely people are to complete the form. Remember, the goal is to make it as easy as possible for users to convert.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">18. Display trust signals and social proof</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Trust signals and social proof can significantly increase your form conversion rates by building trust with your potential customers and site visitors. This might involve displaying security badges, testimonials, or the number of satisfied customers you have.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if you&#8217;re asking for sensitive information like credit card details, displaying a security badge can reassure users that their information will be safe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, testimonials can show people that others have had positive experiences with your company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the Akismet homepage, there’s a prominent display of how many pieces of spam have been blocked, how many websites have been protected, and the spam detection accuracy.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2023/08/image9.png\" alt=\"amount of spam blocked by Akismet\" class=\"wp-image-236617\" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">19. Clearly state your privacy policy</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In an era where data privacy is a major concern, you need to clearly state your privacy policy on your forms. Let visitors know exactly how their information will be used and stored. This transparency can build trust and increase the likelihood of people completing your form.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consider adding a link to your full privacy policy for those who want more detailed information. Also, reassure users that their information will not be shared with third parties without their consent.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">20. Provide instructions and help text</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While your form should be intuitive and easy to understand, providing additional instructions and help text can guide users through the process and prevent errors. This can be particularly useful for complex fields that require specific formats or information.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Help text should be concise and clearly visible, ideally placed directly under the field it refers to. Providing this extra guidance can improve the user experience and increase form completion rates.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">21. Offer live chat assistance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Offering live chat assistance can provide immediate help to users who are having trouble with your form. This real-time support can resolve issues quickly, preventing them from abandoning the form out of frustration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Live chat can also provide valuable insights into common issues or obstacles, allowing you to continually improve your form based on feedback.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">22. Use action-oriented submit buttons</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The text on your submit button can influence whether users complete your form. Just as you work to refine your call to action copy in other areas, you should pay careful attention to the language used on form buttons. Instead of using a generic term like &#8220;Submit,&#8221; consider a more action-oriented and specific term that tells users what they&#8217;re accomplishing by clicking the button.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, if your form is for a newsletter sign-up, your button call to action might say &#8220;Join our community.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or, if it&#8217;s a purchase form, it might say &#8220;Complete my purchase.&#8221; This small tweak can make your form more engaging and motivate users to take action.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another example is on the Akismet checkout form, which confirms how much a customer will pay:</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2023/08/image7.png\" alt=\"Akismet checkout form\" class=\"wp-image-236618\" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">23. Make your buttons stand out</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The design of your submit button can significantly increase conversions on your forms. Your button should stand out from the rest of the form, making it clear where someone needs to click to submit the form.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consider using a contrasting color for your button and placing it in a prominent location. The size of the button also matters — it should be large enough to be easily tapped on a mobile device, but not so large that it overwhelms the rest of the form.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">24. Use friendly and descriptive error messages</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Error messages matter a great deal in form design as well. They guide users in correcting mistakes, but if they&#8217;re not handled well, they can frustrate users and lead to form abandonment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ensure that your error messages are friendly, descriptive, and helpful. Instead of simply saying &#8220;Invalid input,&#8221; explain what the error is and how to fix it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, &#8220;The email address you entered is not in the correct format. Please enter a valid email address.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">25. A/B test form elements</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, one of the most effective ways to increase your form conversion rates is to continually test and optimize your forms. A/B testing involves creating two versions of your form, each with a different element, and seeing which one performs better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can A/B test almost any aspect of your form, from the color of your submission button to the wording of your field labels. There are several WordPress plugins that can help you A/B test your forms easily, like <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/nelio-ab-testing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Nelio A/B Testing</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2023/08/image8.png\" alt=\"Nelio Testing homepage\" class=\"wp-image-236619\" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Increase your online form conversion rate with careful planning</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Increasing the conversion rates of your sign up form, lead generation forms or other web forms is a multifaceted process that involves thoughtful design, user-friendly features, and continuous optimization. By implementing the strategies discussed in this article, you can create a web form that not only provides a seamless user experience but also effectively drives conversions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One key aspect of this process is ensuring your forms are protected from spam in a non-intrusive way. That&#8217;s where Akismet has a role to play. With its robust, <a href=\"https://akismet.com/pricing/\">conversion-friendly spam protection</a>, Akismet allows you to maintain the integrity of your forms and protect the user experience — without the need for CAPTCHA.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, as you work on optimizing all the forms on your site, consider Akismet as your partner in creating a more secure, user-friendly, and conversion-optimized form experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Frequently asked questions</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s now turn our attention to some frequently asked questions about form design and conversion rate optimization.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. How do I decide which form fields are essential and which can be removed?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Deciding which form fields are essential depends on the purpose of your web form. While it’s best to limit required fields, If it&#8217;s a contact form conversion rate you’re working on, for example, you&#8217;ll likely still need fields for the user&#8217;s name, email address, and message .</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Any additional fields should be carefully considered. Ask yourself if the information is necessary to achieve the purpose of the form. If not, it might be best to remove the field to keep the form short and simple.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Why should I avoid using CAPTCHA on my contact forms?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While CAPTCHA can be effective at preventing spam, it can also deter legitimate users. CAPTCHAs can be frustrating and time-consuming, especially if they&#8217;re difficult to solve. They can also pose accessibility issues for users with impairments. Instead, consider using non-intrusive spam protection methods, like Akismet, that provide a better user experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. What is Akismet, and how can it help with form conversion rates?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://akismet.com/\">Akismet</a> is an anti-spam plugin for WordPress sites. It automatically checks and filters out spam comments, allowing you to focus on managing your site. By preventing spam without the need for CAPTCHAs or other intrusive methods, Akismet can improve the user experience and increase form conversion rates.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. What types of companies generally use Akismet?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Akismet is used by a wide range of companies, from small businesses to <a href=\"https://akismet.com/enterprise/\">large enterprises</a>. It&#8217;s particularly popular among companies that rely heavily on their online presence, such as ecommerce businesses and content creators.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With over 100 million sites using Akismet, it&#8217;s clear that this tool is trusted by many. Notable enterprise brands such as Microsoft, <a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/convertkit-customerstory/\">ConvertKit</a>, and Bluehost rely on Akismet to protect their sites from spam and improve their user experience.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 13:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12:\"Kathryn Marr\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:25;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:71:\"Do The Woo Community: Live From WCUS, It’s the Robbie and Robert Show\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=76369\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:66:\"https://dothewoo.io/live-from-wcus-its-the-robbie-and-robert-show/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:416:\"<p>It\'s filled with laughs, insights and simply good times when co-hosts Robbie and Robert take over the mics at WCUS 2023.</p>\n<p>&gt;&gt; The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dothewoo.io/live-from-wcus-its-the-robbie-and-robert-show/\">Live From WCUS, It&#8217;s the Robbie and Robert Show</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dothewoo.io\">Do the Woo - a WooCommerce Builder Community</a>	.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 13:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:26;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:41:\"HeroPress: WordPress Is My Ball And Chain\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=5792\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:134:\"https://heropress.com/essays/wordpress-is-my-ball-and-chain/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=wordpress-is-my-ball-and-chain\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9056:\"<img width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" src=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/essay-cover-1024x512.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"WordPress, and its inclusive community, led me down a path of redemption and acceptance.\" />\nHere is Justin&#8217;s story read aloud by artificial intelligence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This month marks the 22nd anniversary of the terrorist attacked on the World Trade Center in the United States. I can still remember exactly where I was that morning, as I had an argument with my girlfriend the night before, and was sleeping on the couch of someone with whom I used drugs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It had only been four months since graduating high school, but I was already an addict. As a matter of fact, I was using drugs heavily at the end of my senior year, and the first summer after high school is when my life really started to spiral out of control.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By the end of 2001 I was selling any drug I could get my hands on to make some money and feed my addiction (except heroin — that is always were I drew the line). Within a couple years I was the goto person for many substances, but primarily methamphetamine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then I got caught, arrested, and thrown in jail. The prosecutor wanted to throw the book at me, recommending a 15 year sentence. But with my family supporting me in the courtroom and my lawyer fighting for me, the judge recognized that with this support, I did not deserve the full 15, and gave me 7 years, with 8 years probation instead. With good behavior, I did just under 3 years in prison.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While in prison, I focused on my restoration. Learning new things, studying for certification in motor vehicle mechanics, and even starting work with accredited college courses funded by my tribe (Comanche Nation).</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p> I knew I had let down my family, and had something to prove.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Through it all, my addiction, prison, and restoration, my family was always there for me. They knew the real me, not the person addicted to drugs and not the dealer feeding his addiction by providing for other addicts. That’s the person I know I needed to be again, for both myself and for them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right after my release in January 2008, I immediately started working in a warehouse and attending college. At the company where I worked, the CEO gave me some excellent advice that I needed to control my narrative on the web (e.g. Google), so I built my first website using WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-pivoting\">Pivoting</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At a young age, I was always fascinated by technology. I remember dabbling with computers in grade school, and tinkering on the internet in my teens. While I never did any kind of coding back then, the marketing aspect of web technologies did pique my interest. Then, drugs pulled me away from all that and sent me down a different path.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I found WordPress around April of 2008, all of that excitement started to come back. I would work my warehouse job during the day, drive to University of Central Oklahoma in the evening for a couple of college courses, then play around with WordPress themes (HTML, CSS, and some PHP) well into the night all that summer. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>This was the beginning of my love for WordPress. I was instantly addicted, and simply could not put down my computer, often getting little sleep before the next day (that’s okay, I was in my early 20s <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f609.png\" alt=\"😉\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> ).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>By late 2010, I was taking on WordPress side projects, building websites, and even making online tutorials about WordPress. All this despite still working in the warehouse and taking night courses at college.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2011, my work caught the eye of <a href=\"https://corymiller.com/\">Cory Miller</a>, who I had previously met at a marketing event in Oklahoma City. Cory owned and operated <a href=\"https://ithemes.com/\">iThemes</a>, a WordPress theme and plugin product company based out of Edmond Oklahoma. Although I was still working in the warehouse and taking college courses, Cory offered me a job working at iThemes as a web developer for WordPress themes and plugins. My major in college was marketing, and I still has a few more courses to complete before graduating, but I took the offer anyway and little did I know it was the beginning of a career in software development that led me where I am today.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-and-then-wordcamp\">And Then WordCamp&#8230;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>My first WordCamp to both attend and speak was Fayetteville in 2011. That’s actually when I first met <a href=\"https://josepha.blog/\">Josepha Haden Chomphosy</a> (along with her <a href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/wordpress-tool-success/\">mother</a> and sister too). Of course, we went different ways in life but it is a marker that I like to remember as it helps me understand the different paths each of us take in this world. While I only spoke at a few other WordCamps, I attended many more over the years. The WordPress community, and its inclusiveness, was simply impossible for me to ignore.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>I know my experiences are different, and to understand this I also have to mention that I joined a few other communities through the years, but none ever fully accepted me, and one even did not let me keep coming when they found out I was a former convict.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Although most people in the WordPress community never knew about my past, I never felt they would kick me out even if they did find out. Actually, I felt the community leaders honestly didn’t care at all about your past, culture, identity, etc., but rather just wanted you to love (or at least like) WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I did love WordPress. Still do.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Redemption and Acceptance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress unexpectedly led me down a path of redemption and acceptance. For a long time I was angry at the world (especially corporate America) for not accepting me, and in those times of anger I would seek out WordPress people. No one even knew, but they were helping me nonetheless, always there when I needed, always a shiny light in the darkness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve traveled the world with WordPress. Making WordPress friends in Asia, Australia, Europe, North &amp; South America and beyond. I love the WordPress community, and want to continue watching it flourish and grow. Every time I visit a WordCamp, I get to make new friends, see new faces, and meet awesome people of WordPress. I was able to build meaningful business and personal relationships, joining WordPress communities, attending and hosting WordPress events, and even speaking at several WordCamps across the World.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of the WordPress companies for which I have worked had such amazing leaders, knowing about my past yet still giving me the opportunity to continue to demonstrate my new self. Two of which deserve an honorable mention: Cory Miller of Post Status (formerly iThemes) and <a href=\"https://10up.com/blog/author/10up/\">Jake Goldman</a> of <a href=\"https://10up.com/\">10up</a>. Both of these leaders embraced me wholly, and the things Jake said to when I mentioned my criminal past before my background check continue to give me confidence in knowing there are amazing leaders working in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The WordPress Community has proven itself to be more than just a platform for a tool. In my personal journey, I discovered that it represents a beacon of hope, a testament to what can be achieved when diverse minds come together under the banner of openness and collaboration. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>Albeit unknowingly, this community handed me a new lease on life, providing me with opportunities to learn, grow, and reinvent myself.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Its core values of openness and inclusiveness aren&#8217;t just buzzwords but are deeply rooted in the ethos of every member who contributes, either by writing code, designing themes, or even just by sharing experiences. It&#8217;s a reminder that every individual, irrespective of their background or skillset, has the potential to add value to this thriving ecosystem. As beneficiaries of this incredible community, it falls upon us to ensure that we not only appreciate these values but also embody them. We must commit to fostering an environment where every decision we make, every action we undertake, further deepens the culture of inclusivity and collaboration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you WordPress, and the WordPress Community. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2764.png\" alt=\"❤\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/wordpress-is-my-ball-and-chain/\">WordPress Is My Ball And Chain</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 12:26:44 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:16:\"Justin Kopepasah\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:27;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:136:\"WPTavern: WooCommerce Blocks 11.0.0 Adds Product Collection Block in Beta, 10.9.0 Integrates Product Button with the Interactivity API\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=148515\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:144:\"https://wptavern.com/woocommerce-blocks-11-0-0-adds-product-collection-block-in-beta-10-9-0-integrates-product-button-with-the-interactivity-api\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4015:\"<p>WooCommerce is experimenting with improving the store experience through the <a href=\"https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks/issues/8219\">addition of the Interactivity API</a> to the WooCommerce Blocks plugin. The new API, which was announced earlier this year, will allow developers to build interactive blocks that support frontend experiences where visitors can interact with content without having to refresh the page. The WordPress contributors working on the API are <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/start-testing-wordpress-new-interactivity-api\">encouraging developers to test it</a> with their own blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.woocommerce.com/2023/08/16/woocommerce-blocks-10-9-0-release-notes/?mc_cid=b50d0ff43c&mc_eid=68ffa9a210\">WooCommerce Blocks 10.9.0</a>, released in mid-August, integrated the Product Button with the Interactivity API to support real-time counter updates for the mini-cart, smoother animations, and better transitions from ‘Add to Cart’ to ‘Loading’ status to show the quantity in the cart when a product is added. </p>\n\n\n\nWooCommerce Blocks <a href=\"https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks/pull/10006\">PR #10006</a>\n\n\n\n<p>The difference is subtle but creates a much smoother shopping experience with nearly instantaneous feedback for the user. Contributors are also exploring how the Interactivity API can be used to improve frontend filters, including the rating, price, stock, and attributes filters. The API will eventually land in Gutenberg and WordPress in the future, but in the meantime WooCommerce is experimenting to see how the plugin&#8217;s blocks can benefit from it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.woocommerce.com/2023/08/31/woocommerce-blocks-11-0-0-release-notes/\">Version 11.0.0</a> was released last week introducing the new Product Collection block in beta:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>Like the Products block, you can choose what criteria affect the list of blocks displayed to shoppers and control the product layout in the list/grid by the various element blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike the Products block, which is a Query loop block variation, this block is a standalone block, enabling us to tailor the block further to better meet the merchant’s needs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The Product Collection block is very similar to the Products block from which it was forked, except it is not built as a variation of the Query Loop. It comes with improvements around Inspector controls as compared to the current Products block, as well as a basic set of patterns. The block already has the <a href=\"https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks/issues/10328\">Interactivity API integrated</a> for the same improved frontend performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"2047\" height=\"1584\" src=\"https://149611589.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/product-collection.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-148556\" />Product Collection block &#8211; image source: <a href=\"https://developer.woocommerce.com/2023/08/31/woocommerce-blocks-11-0-0-release-notes/\">WooCommerce Blocks 11.0.0 release post</a>\n\n\n\n<p>Version 11.0.0 also enables manual migration of Products to Product Collection.

At the first event, the agency showcased some early work in the <a href=\"https://www.altis-dxp.com/accelerate/\">Altis Accelerate</a> plugin and have been working with clients to determine how AI can augment existing marketing and editorial workflows. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The progress and innovation we’re seeing in AI is so rapid at the moment that it kind of demands you stay close to it, keep following what’s happening, and keep learning,&#8221; Human Made Marketing Director Alex Aspinall said. &#8220;AI is one of our core areas of focus, across all parts of the business, so we’ll definitely be building, sharing, and hosting more in the space in the months to come. Doing all this in the open is really important to us, so the events are a great platform.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the first event, Aspinall reports that Human Made saw registrations and participation across a wide range of business verticals and role disciplines, with conversations continuing months after the first event. <br /><br />&#8220;While there are a few businesses and individuals building things, experimenting, and commercializing their work in the area, the vast majority are still finding their way through, figuring out how best to implement AI to deliver tangible benefit to their companies, their clients, their teams, and their day-to-day lives,&#8221; Aspinall said.<br /><br />&#8220;Despite the level of advancement we’ve already seen, we’re still right at the start of this thing, which is really exciting. There’s a lot to learn, and considerable edge available for those experimenting and putting things in place. Imagine what we’ll be talking about this time next year!&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 05 Sep 2023 22:09:23 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:29;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:50:\"Do The Woo Community: WordCamp US, the First Recap\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=76362\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:48:\"https://dothewoo.io/wordcamp-us-the-first-recap/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:362:\"<p>BobWP and some attendees share a few highlights of WordCamp US 2023 as well as some WordPress origin stories.</p>\n<p>&gt;&gt; The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dothewoo.io/wordcamp-us-the-first-recap/\">WordCamp US, the First Recap</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dothewoo.io\">Do the Woo - a WooCommerce Builder Community</a>	.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 05 Sep 2023 13:23:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:30;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Matt: Techcrunch with Gutenberg\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"https://ma.tt/?p=96577\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:48:\"https://ma.tt/2023/09/techcrunch-with-gutenberg/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:245:\"<p>Jamie Marsland has this great YouTube video where he rebuilds <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/\">TechCrunch.com</a> just using core blocks in WordPress 6.3 in 30 minutes.

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:28] (Intro Music)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:39] <strong>Josepha:</strong>&nbsp;We are back and catching up from our midyear break. And in true WordPress fashion, we&#8217;re just going to start off running. The WordPress Community Summit happened a couple of weeks ago. I&#8217;ve been talking about it on this podcast for a few months now, but if you&#8217;ve missed it and you want a refresher, go ahead and give episode 49 a listen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the Community Summit, there were 125 people, if I remember correctly. And we covered a wide array of topics that were brought to us directly from the community itself. While the event is small, it is specifically designed for gathering and sharing information. So, I&#8217;ve got some top-level trends that I noticed that I&#8217;m going to share with you all today, as well as just like a reminder of what happens after a Community Summit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:27] <strong>Josepha:</strong>&nbsp;So there are three, maybe four, big trends that I noticed. The first one that I noticed is that we have a lot of discussions right now about contributor acknowledgment. That also, for what it&#8217;s worth, came with an unresolved question around whether acknowledgment and recognition are the same. I don&#8217;t think they are the same.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it also was part of a conversation around whether we treat those two things the same. And if they are not the same, should we treat them differently? And et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. For folks who&#8217;ve been around for a bit, you know, that we spent a lot of time working on our contributor recognition a few years back and had really made quite a bit of difference in just reported feelings about how the community felt they were being recognized for their contributions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so a lot of the conversations that we ended up having were around whether or not the project as a whole has changed the way that we provide that recognition or acknowledgment. Or, as an alternative, if the community that is supporting WordPress has changed how they would like to be recognized.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:32] <strong>Josepha:</strong>&nbsp;There were also some questions about whether or not making sure that contributors can see their impact. Like they can say, I contributed 10 hours last month, and these are the two things that I got accomplished over there, and that everyone else can see those things too. So, how we can do that more easily while also not having so many metrics and making the metrics so prevalent that we start to close out the people who are truly just doing this for fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like many of the problems that we have at the Community Summit, this is a bunch of pretty much unsolved mysteries at the moment. But it did; it came up across probably five or six different sessions that I heard about, quite a few that I went to myself, and so contributor acknowledgment and recognition is on our minds again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A second thing that I noticed across multiple sessions, and this one honestly is not a surprise at all, is that there were a lot of questions about what the next big thing is after Gutenberg. I always love when people are asking big questions about what comes next because it means that we all still believe that there will be a next.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:43] <strong>Josepha:</strong>&nbsp;And so I never hesitate when I hear these questions to give some ideas about what I think might be coming. But a lot of the discussions that we were having were around, we think this is coming, but now that we think this is coming, what should we do now to make sure that we are ready for it? One of the biggest assumptions that we all had is that for the CMS, for the software itself, probably our next big area after Gutenberg is going to be something about artificial intelligence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matt pointed out in his presentation that he has told us twice to learn something deeply. One was in 2016 when he said, learn JavaScript Deeply. And then one was in 2022 when he said to learn AI deeply. And so we all kind of are guessing that that is our future area. And so that&#8217;s an area for everyone to spend some time in. Make sure you understand it. Make sure you know it a bit.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing that came up as like a future, where are we going here? It was kind of on the business-y side. It was on a lot of questions about enterprise and are we selling properly to enterprise. Can we sell, can we appeal to enterprise? Whose job is it to sell any of these things? Questions like that. So, lots of business questions again. This is not something that I have any concerns about. I&#8217;m very excited to see that people are talking about it. That&#8217;s been a topic of conversation since, I want to say, February of this year. And so it also wasn&#8217;t a surprise inclusion today. And, and I was excited to see, am excited to see what we get out of those conversations over time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:17] <strong>Josepha:</strong>&nbsp;As far as like questions around what&#8217;s next for the community, I&#8217;m going to address that separately because it was a huge question for everyone. So I&#8217;m going to discuss that as soon as we get finished with this chunk about like the big thing that, that is coming after Gutenberg.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, from an ecosystem perspective. Like a WordPress project operations perspective, this came up a couple of times. Never in as clear a word, a set of words as that, but the question about, like, what are we doing with our tools? Are we making sure that we are keeping the tools that our contributors use maintained and still in an excellent space with features that are useful and, necessary, and requested?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so that is a big question. I do have a lot of questions about that. Also, there are so many tools that I have wanted in order to make organizing the WordPress community better and easier, but also making contributing better and easier. And hopefully, here soon, we have an opportunity to get to some of those.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:16] <strong>Josepha:</strong>&nbsp;So, the third big trend that I kept seeing at the Community Summit is actually about the community itself, specifically about events. So I was part of or listened to many, many, many conversations over the course of the week that were specifically focused on what we&#8217;re going to do with the future of our events. Like are meetups still sustainable? Are WordCamps still sustainable? And that&#8217;s from not only the idea of sustainability that we all tend to know from like an ecological standpoint but also, you know, checking in on the resources. So the kinds of questions that folks had were, is it time to continue having many small events, or is it time to move to a few giant events?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Should we bring back midsized, WP-adjacent events like PressNomics or LoopConf? And if we are bringing those back, do we want to have them be part of a semi-official thing along with a clearly WordPress event and like do joint sales in there? Try to figure out how to get people from one to the other, so that it&#8217;s not just WordPress people that we&#8217;re talking to, but also business people and advanced developers, things like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was also a lot of discussion about whether or not we have gotten too big, should we double down on our grassroots efforts? Just go all the way back to, like, BarCamp style, WordPress in a forest kind of thing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:46] <strong>Josepha:</strong>&nbsp;And yeah, and among all of these conversations, there were questions about the resources that we need. Do we have what we need now? Do we have plans for how to maintain those resources in the future? Do we have enough time? Do we have enough money? Do we have an expertise? The people? So many questions, so many questions. And on the community side of things, we also had a lot of questions that are routine in open source. Like, do we have a pipeline for future maintainers, for future team reps, for future leaders in the project? All of the questions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, those are the three slash four, depending on how you break it out, really big trends that I saw across the conversation at the Community Summit. And I don&#8217;t necessarily know the answers to all of these things. Like, I know what my gut tells me, I know what I believe the answer to be. From my own perspective, but as you&#8217;ve been told many times with many eyes, all bugs are shallow. And so here is what happens next with a Community Summit. So we&#8217;ve gathered all of these things together. We&#8217;ve had these conversations, and now all of the notes from every conversation that we had will be put on make.wordpress.org/summit.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:10] <strong>Josepha:</strong>&nbsp;There, you can do any of the following three things, but at least do one before we get any further. I think it&#8217;s important to remind everyone that no decisions were made at the Community Summit. There are a few things that will come out of the Community Summit where the answer the way forward is really obvious. And so those probably will get done quickly thereafter because it&#8217;s just an obvious thing to do. It makes sense for everyone in the project. It makes sense for everyone who&#8217;s using WordPress. Whatever reason.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So those things will probably move quickly, but mostly not even mostly there were no decisions made. And so if it looks like something is moving quickly there, it is because it makes sense after the fact. So there&#8217;s that. But the three things that you can do in order to take part in this information gathering and sharing that happened at the Community Summit.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Number one, head over to make.wordpress.org/summit and just read the notes. There are a lot of them you can pick and choose based on the teams you contribute to or the topics that are specifically interesting. Or if you have been assigned to read one of these things, obviously, go ahead and read that. But find the notes read them. Take a look at the discussion as far as you can tell it happened and get a sense for what the essential question is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing that you can do while you&#8217;re there is that you can join in that discussion right there in the comments if you would like to. You can, if you feel like your perspective is not quite accounted for in that, obviously leave some comments and let folks know. But also, if you feel like your perspective was accounted for, but there&#8217;s also a very specific question that was not necessarily answered or not even brought up, share those as well. That&#8217;s stuff that we would like to know as we are working through this.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the third thing that you can do is you can take those conversations, and if there&#8217;s anything that looks like it&#8217;s particularly relevant to your local WordPress community, absolutely take those there and have those conversations with them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:23] <strong>Josepha:</strong>&nbsp;And once you&#8217;ve had those conversations, let us know what you thought also in those comments, or take it directly into your weekly teams&#8217; chat, either way. We want to hear what you think about the questions that were brought because you brought them to us. And so you should have an opportunity to tell us what you think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:39] (Music Interlude)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:48] <strong>Josepha:</strong>&nbsp;That brings us now to our small list of big things. My friends, there&#8217;s nothing but big things left for the rest of the year. And so here we go. Number one, uh, I mentioned it quite a bit. There&#8217;s a conversation, an ongoing conversation about the future of events for our community. Right now, there is an open call for ideas, new features for our NextGen WordPress events, especially on the page that exists on WordCamp Central.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, we want to find the most useful and desirable features for a future homepage on central.wordcamp.org that would host a list of all of our upcoming WordPress events. And so we want your opinion there. Please let us know what would be especially useful to you as you are looking for WordPress events to attend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing is that we introduced 2024, the default theme that is coming with WordPress 6.4, was announced. We have had, I think, 32 contributors to it at the time of this recording. And yeah, it&#8217;s beautiful. It&#8217;s got a lot of different implementation options, a lot of default patterns, and curated patterns so that you can get exactly what you want out of that theme. I think it&#8217;s going to make a great default theme, a great starter theme for our final release of the year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, speaking of 6.4, with the release of 6.3 behind us, we are working hard on bringing 6.4 to the community. You can get involved with the development of that. There is a core chat every Wednesday. It happens. I want to say at 21:00 UTC, but I don&#8217;t actually know off the top of my head. I just go when my calendar tells me to go, and I live in the central time zone. And so, my UTC conversion is not the best, but we will leave the actual information about that in the show notes so that you can see it. But you can also go over to make.wordpress.org, and then there&#8217;s a little card on that homepage that tells you exactly when those core meetings are, including the new contributor meeting, which happens every two weeks.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the fourth thing is that there is a successful WordCamp US behind us. That is our final flagship event of the year, which is always exciting. If you missed it, for one, we missed you. And for two, we have you covered. We&#8217;ve got a recap of the event. There is a link to that in the show notes as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:05] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And that, my friends, is your small list of big things. Thanks for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy, and I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:15] (Music Outro)&nbsp;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 04 Sep 2023 12:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Brett McSherry\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:33;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:132:\"Gutenberg Times: Talks at WordCamp US, Notes from the Community summit.

In this case, many of these plugin authors have included zero contact information in their extensions or are not responding to communication attempts. Patchstack has characterized it as a &#8220;<a href=\"https://patchstack.com/articles/the-wordpress-zombie-plugins-pandemic-affects-1-6-million-websites/\">zombie plugins pandemic</a>&#8221; due to the overwhelming number of abandoned plugins affecting more than 1.6 million sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The WordPress.org Plugins Team has acted on the report by closing more than 70% of the plugins. In June, the team <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-plugin-review-team-adds-6-new-sponsored-volunteers-opens-applications\">added six new sponsored volunteers</a> and opened applications for more team members but have <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-plugin-review-team-addresses-backlog-of-900-plugins-implements-strategies-to-improve-approval-process\">struggled with managing a formidable backlog</a> of plugins waiting to be reviews.

This is his 10th round of capturing performance data from hosting companies that opt into the testing. Ohashi&#8217;s <a href=\"https://wphostingbenchmarks.com/methodology/\">methodology</a> tests two metrics through a variety of methods: peak performance and consistency. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The benchmarks include a LoadStorm test designed to simulate real users visiting the site, logging in, and browsing (uncached performance). They also test cached performance, SSL, WP queries per second, performance on some computational and database operations, and a WebPageTest that fully loads the homepage and records how long it takes from 12 different locations around the world. As part of the consistency testing, Ohashi also measures uptime using <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://hetrixtools.com/uptime-monitor/166399.html\" target=\"_blank\">HetrixTools</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://uptimerobot.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Uptime Robot</a> for a minimum of three months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Participants pay a standard, publicly documented fee, based on the price tier of the product being tested, to cover the costs. Ohashi does not accept sponsorships for the tests, and has become one of the most trusted sources for unbiased performance reviews of WordPress hosting plans.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2023, Ohashi tested 31 companies across 72 plans and seven pricing tiers, with tests nearly identical to previous years. He made minimal adjustments to the LoadStorm test script to improve performance and make it compatible with newer versions of k6.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The website makes it easy to review results at a glance by using a star system. Hosts that achieve &#8220;Top Tier&#8221; status receive a full star:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>This is awarded to companies who maintain 99.9% uptime throughout the entire testing and show little to no performance degradation during load testing, primarily focused on error rate and consistent response times. Error rates above 0.1% and response times above 1000ms* will keep a company away from achieving Top Tier marks.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The half star indicates &#8220;Honorable Mention&#8221; status, which is given to companies that came close to Top Tier but fell just short, such as struggling slightly on a load test.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Among budget hosts in the <a href=\"https://wphostingbenchmarks.com/benchmark/2023-25-wordpress/\">&lt;$25/month category</a>, the majority of hosts (16/21) rang in at the Top Tier level. Those who did not earn Top Tier status were held back by inferior performance on the the LoadStorm test&nbsp;for the most part, even though several still took top scores in other aspects of the testing. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1222\" height=\"1194\" src=\"https://149611589.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screen-Shot-2023-09-01-at-11.58.44-AM.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-148428\" />\n\n\n\n<p>There are fewer participants at the $25-50 plan (and other more expensive plans) but the results are similar to the budget hosts, with A2 Hosting, Cloudways, and Stromonic edged out of contention for Top Tier. All three failed to achieve Top Tier for any of the plans tested this year. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the <a href=\"https://wphostingbenchmarks.com/benchmark/2023-enterprise-wordpress/\">Enterprise tier ($500+)</a>, the majority of participants handled the LoadStorm test without issue. When testing cached performance, Ohashi found that the overall field of participants is getting faster: </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>Excluding Seravo, every company was 33ms average or below and 43ms p95 or below. Compared to last year where the fastest average was 6.4 ms and p95 was 20ms. There are four companies this year below both of those levels. The performance at the Enterprise tier is mind bogglingly fast and getting even faster which is hard to comprehend when last year&#8217;s 6.4ms was beaten by 4 plans this year.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"2094\" height=\"1304\" src=\"https://149611589.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screen-Shot-2023-09-01-at-1.13.36-PM.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-148433\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Most of the entrants in the <a href=\"https://wphostingbenchmarks.com/benchmark/2023-woocommerce/\">WooCommerce category</a> earned Top Tier status, with the exception of Blallo and Cloudways, both of which stumbled on the LoadStorm test. The hosting plans tested range from $25.95/month &#8211; $99/month. The WooCommerce-specific tests collect average response times, total requests, errors, and other metrics across four different profiles:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Profile 1 (20%): Buyer – Homepage, add item to cart, go to cart, checkout (doesn’t submit order)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Profile 2 (10%): Customer (existing) – Homepage, login, view orders, view account details</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Profile 3 (20%): Browser – Homepage, visit 5 random product pages</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Profile 4 (50%): Home – Homepage only</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>A more detailed breakdown is available on the WooCommerce benchmarks results page.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"2350\" height=\"1208\" src=\"https://149611589.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screen-Shot-2023-09-01-at-2.56.46-PM.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-148441\" />\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s important to note that the tests do not clearly identify a winner or top performer. They also don&#8217;t take into account other aspects of the WordPress hosting experience, like reviews, support, and features. Ohashi tests the defaults for all of these plans, but if there are more optimization features that can be customized for sites (which are not clearly outlined in the initial setup) then those are also not taken into account. The methodology simply focuses on performance, so it&#8217;s just one factor of hosting, albeit a very important one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;As far as surprising results, I keep thinking &#8216;Are we nearing the point that we won&#8217;t see much improvement?&#8217; and each year the whole field gets faster and faster,&#8221; Ohashi said. &#8220;Even improving on sub 10ms times between years. For example, in the &lt;$25/month tier, in 2022 there were 3 companies with &lt;50ms average response time on the Static k6 test. This year there are 10. I also saw 100ms+ improvements from the other (slower) side bringing up the whole field a meaningful amount. Everyone is getting faster and faster.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why Are Some Managed WordPress Hosting Companies Missing?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many leading WordPress managed hosts that are notably absent from Ohashi&#8217;s benchmarks, whose inclusion would be helpful for a deeper understanding of market. I asked him about a handful of them and he reported that WP Engine, DreamHost, and Kinsta declined to participate this year, to name a few. GoDaddy took a year off but may be back next year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The major reasons for hosts not wanting to participate fall into a few categories, and bad performance is chief among them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Some companies perform poorly or poorly relative to price and don&#8217;t want to participate anymore,&#8221; Ohashi said. &#8220;They usually talk about other &#8216;intangible&#8217; values that you can&#8217;t measure. I think good performance should be a default for every&nbsp;hosting company, and good companies shouldn&#8217;t be afraid of bad results &#8211; if they actually plan on improving their services. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;But some would probably rather spend fortunes on marketing instead of better engineering, and bad results aren&#8217;t going to help their&nbsp;marketing. I personally love seeing companies who participate year after year despite mixed results. I respect the companies&nbsp;who consistently earn Top Tier are doing a great job. But there&#8217;s something special about companies willing to put themselves out there regardless of the results, because it&#8217;s a public and open commitment to improving.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ohashi said that occasionally the timing doesn&#8217;t work out where a host is going through a major engineering overhaul during the testing and doesn&#8217;t want the platform benchmarked when they are about to release a new one. In this case some opt to skip a year. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The costs of the benchmarking can also be prohibitive for some smaller hosting companies. Ohashi raised prices by $250 across all tiers this year (eg. $100-&gt;$350, $500-&gt;$750) to cover his costs. Although this doesn&#8217;t seem like much for a hosting company, they also have to pay for the servers for four months, and have the staff/resources available to work with Ohashi on organizing, executing, and debugging issues. 20i, Krystal Hosting, Nexcess, and Pressable agreed to sponsor upstart companies in the space for 2023.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another reason some hosts don&#8217;t participate is a lack of interest or value. They don&#8217;t see how they can use the benchmark results to their advantage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Some companies don&#8217;t get as much value from the benchmarks as others,&#8221; Ohashi said. &#8220;Performance across the board has gone way up. It&#8217;s harder and harder to stand out. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I think some companies may view it as an instant validation and reason for customers to come busting down the doors. But there are a lot of great companies offering great performance. Earning Top Tier status means you&#8217;ve got a performant hosting platform. It&#8217;s great, and it can help validate some customer needs/desires in the decision making funnel, but it won&#8217;t magically generate tons of sales.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ohashi said he has put together notes for hosting companies that earned Top Tier status to help them leverage more value this year from a marketing perspective, based on what he has seen some companies do with their results. Creating more value for participating companies is something he is actively working to improve upon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although Review Signal had approximately 35,000 people visit in the past year, Ohashi doesn&#8217;t think the traffic captures the full value of the benchmarks very well. The people who dig into these metrics are those who have a large impact on where their WordPress clients host their websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The people who care about the benchmarks are seriously into WordPress / hosting / performance,&#8221; Ohashi said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a lot of agencies, developers, large website owners and hosting people. One way I&#8217;ve measured impact is by going to the major WordCamps (EU/Asia/US) and talking to people. The number of folks who are aware of the benchmarks there was surprisingly&nbsp;high to me. The people who are interested enough to spend time at WordCamps are the same folks interested in reading the benchmarks. It&#8217;s not the largest number of people who read them, but it is the largest impact people who read and value them.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 01 Sep 2023 21:17:38 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:37;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:55:\"Do The Woo Community: WooBits Hits the Air Waves, Again\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=76231\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"https://dothewoo.io/woobits-hits-the-air-waves-again/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:341:\"<p>WooBits takes another twist and turn and introducing Global Community Friends.</p>\n<p>&gt;&gt;

It incorporates some of the proposed solutions and speeds up translations by converting <code>.mo</code> files to <code>.php</code> files, allowing them to be parsed faster and stored in <a href=\"https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.opcache.php\">OPcache</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It supports multiple file formats (<code>.mo</code>, <code>.php</code>, and <code>.json</code>) and multiple text domains and locales loaded at the same time. Existing <code>.mo</code> files get converted to <code>.php</code> files which are then loaded by WordPress.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A chart included on the plugin&#8217;s details page shows a significant page load time reduction when using the plugin, as compared to sites with translations that don&#8217;t use the plugin. The plugin brings translations very close to the same page load times as English (non-translated) sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1658\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://149611589.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/performant-translations.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-148367\" />\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;With enough testing and feedback, we hope to eventually merge this plugin into WordPress core,&#8221; Performance Team contributor Pascal Birchler said when announcing the plugin on X.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;In the coming weeks and months we will share more testing instructions and continue to improve the plugin. This will be made available via Performance Lab, too.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users who are testing the plugin can <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/performant-translations/#new-topic-0\">report issues on the support forum</a> or create an issue on the <a href=\"https://github.com/swissspidy/performant-translations\">GitHub repository</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Performant Translations is considered to be a beta testing plugin but can be tested and used in production at your own risk. It doesn&#8217;t require any changes to settings or configuration after installation. The plugin can be safely removed after testing, because it essentially cleans up after itself. All <code>.php</code> files it generates will be removed by the server once the plugin is deactivated and uninstalled. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 30 Aug 2023 01:39:18 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:40;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:84:\"WPTavern: Top Agencies Join Forces to Publish Free Guide on WordPress for Enterprise\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=148240\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:95:\"https://wptavern.com/top-agencies-join-forces-to-publish-free-guide-on-wordpress-for-enterprise\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2611:\"<p>A collection of leading WordPress agencies have launched a collaborative project to promote the platform to large-scale organizations.

It includes short chapters on the following topics:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>From small blogs to big brands </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Open source advantages </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Platform security&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Scalability and internationalization</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Solution cost and value&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Editorial experience&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Performance matters </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Feature extensibility</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Headless capabilities</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>“While smaller brands are able to switch CMS platforms fairly easily, for large-scale enterprises it’s often a major undertaking, so we hope this guide makes the decision process much easier for those exploring open source options,&#8221; WordPress VIP Director of Product Marketing Michael Khalili said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The guide is a useful resource for large organizations examining WordPress as a platform or for small agencies looking to pitch WordPress to larger clients.

It includes managed WordPress hosting (whatever that looks like in 100 years), multiple backups across geographically distributed data centers, submission to the Internet Archive if the site is public, 24/7 dedicated support, and a domain that doesn&#8217;t need to be renewed by the customer for a century.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ICANN, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, limits domain registration to a maximum of 10 years. Auto-renewing after this time requires the customer to renew on time and keep their payment method updated. A 100-year plan removes these uncertainties but still hinges on the registrar staying in business into the next century.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Customers who buy into the plan will need to have superior confidence in WordPress.com, coupled with the belief that domain names will still be important to the fundamental architecture of the web decades from now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Automattic CEO Matt Mullenweg commented on the difficulties in pricing the 100-year plan during his presentation at WordCamp US 2023, while simultaneously discouraging WordPress product owners from offering lifetime licenses. The distinction here is that the 100-year plan has a finite length of time, even if its future support seems unfathomable at the moment. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It also got me thinking about lifetime licenses, which I think we should stop doing in the WordPress world,&#8221; Mullenweg said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;ve ever worked with an accountant or an acquirer they don&#8217;t like when you have those because it&#8217;s essentially an open ended commitment, including often with support. How do you recognize that revenue? Offer a 20 year plan or something. I think when you&#8217;re saying &#8216;lifetime,&#8217; it sort of cheapens the word. If we&#8217;re really thinking long-term, what promises we&#8217;re making to our customers, I think we should re-examine those practices.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mullenweg also said he was inspired by the <a href=\"https://longnow.org/\">Long Now Foundation</a>, a non-profit established to foster long term thinking. The organization&#8217;s first project is the &#8220;Clock of the Long Now,&#8221; a mechanical monument designed to keep accurate time for the next 10,000 years:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>It is still being assembled deep inside a mountain in west Texas. The Clock provides a rare invitation to think and engineer at the timescale of civilization. It offers an enduring symbol of our personal connection to the distant future.</p>\n<cite><a href=\"https://longnow.org/\">The Long Now website</a></cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress.com is building something parallel to this in the digital world, enabling people to create their own virtual, lasting monuments and preserve their homes on the web. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Embedded in the new offering is also a poignant reminder that WordPress.com is a domain registrar, as the company recently <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-com-makes-a-bid-for-google-domains-customers-offering-1-million-free-transfers\">made a bid to capture Google Domain customers</a> ahead of their domains being sold off to Squarespace. Even if the new 100-year hosting plan is too expensive for 99.9% of prospective customers, it gives the impression that the company is capable of hosting entrusted domains for the long term. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nobody, not even WordPress.com, knows what that will look like in 50 years, but it&#8217;s an ambitious, thought-provoking offering. What resources will a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) point to 50 years from now? Or will URLs be discarded into the scrap pile of obsolete building blocks as soon as there&#8217;s a better, more efficient way to identify web addresses? What does longevity look like in the digital world?</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 29 Aug 2023 04:25:16 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:43;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"WPTavern: Video: WordPress Leaders Discuss Project’s Future at WordCamp US 2023\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=148270\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:88:\"https://wptavern.com/video-wordpress-leaders-discuss-projects-future-at-wordcamp-us-2023\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3006:\"<p>WordCamp US concluded this weekend after gathering nearly 2,000 attendees in National Harbor, Maryland, for the Community Summit, Contributor Day, and main conference days. For the majority of people in the WordPress world who were unable to attend, the recordings of the presentations from project leadership will give you an idea of what to expect in the near future and beyond. These videos were <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2023/08/the-future-of-wordpress-whats-next-for-gutenberg/\">published</a> right away and are embedded below.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress Executive Director Josepha Haden Chomposy spoke on &#8220;The Future of WordPress,&#8221; with an emphasis on how the project can continue to thrive, build resilience, and outlast its current contributors. She encouraged the community to be proactive about expanding their learning and connections. She also reaffirmed the importance of the project&#8217;s mission to democratize publishing and the impact that can have in the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress co-creator Matt Mullenweg capped off the event with a presentation titled &#8220;What&#8217;s Next for Gutenberg,&#8221; followed by a Q&amp;A. He highlighted a few features coming in 6.4, including font management, an image lightbox, and the new Twenty Twenty Four default theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As WordPress is moving into the Collaboration phase of the Gutenberg project, which will enable multiple authors to edit simultaneously, Mullenweg highlighted the importance of redesigning the admin. This will be the first major redesign since MP6 and is also aimed at improving workflows for administrators.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mullenweg announced that WordPress has launched a new LMS (Learning Management System) working group. He commented on the benefits and drawbacks of having multiple plugins in the ecosystem that do the same thing. Although the competition can encourage more innovation, it can also lock users into one solution if they aren&#8217;t built to be interoperable. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Representatives from Tutor LMS, Learndash, LifterLMS, and Sensei met to discuss using common data models so users can easily switch between solutions. They are working in a new #LMS slack channel to establish industry standards that will preserve user freedom and choice through practical interoperability changes to their products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mullenweg also said he would like to see more plugins, such as those handling SEO or site builders, to agree on some data models so that products can operate in a more standardized and performant way, serving users better in the long term.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check out the presentation below, along with the Q&amp;A that followed. There were more than 80 questions submitted, and those that were missed during Q&amp;A will have answers published to in a future post on WordPress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 28 Aug 2023 22:15:14 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:44;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:87:\"Gutenberg Times: Gutenberg Changelog #88 – WordPress 6.4 and Gutenberg 16.4 and 16.5.\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/?post_type=podcast&p=25373\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:91:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/podcast/gutenberg-changelog-88-wordpress-6-4-and-gutenberg-16-5/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:83824:\"<p>Ellen Bauer and Birgit Pauli-Haack discuss WordPress 6.4 and Gutenberg 16.4 and 16.5 and proposed wp-admin changes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/podcast/gutenberg-changelog-88-wordpress-6-4-and-gutenberg-16-5#shownotes\">Show Notes</a> / <a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/podcast/gutenberg-changelog-88-wordpress-6-4-and-gutenberg-16-5#transcript\">Transcript</a></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Music:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/xirclebox\">Homer Gaines</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Editor:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sandy-reed/\">Sandy Reed</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Logo:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://markuraine.com/\">Mark Uraine</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Production:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://icodeforapurpose.com\">Birgit Pauli-Haack</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-larger-font-size\" id=\"shownotes\"><strong>Show Notes</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Ellen Bauer</strong>, co-founder Elma Studio</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>WordPress <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/elmastudio/\">@elmastudio</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Twitter/X <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ellenbauer\">@ellenbauer</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.elmastudio.de/en/\">Elma Studio</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://ainoblocks.io/\">Aino Blocks</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/elmastudio/#content-themes\">Themes by Elmastudio </a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">WordPress 6.4 and more</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/08/22/roadmap-to-6-4/\">Roadmap 6.4</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/06/05/wordpress-6-4-development-cycle/\">WordPress 6.4 Development Cycle</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/08/24/introducing-twenty-twenty-four/\">Introducing Twenty Twenty-Four</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/08/23/whats-new-for-navigation-in-wordpress-6-2-and-6-3/\">What’s new for Navigation in WordPress 6.2 and 6.3</a>&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Gutenberg </h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/08/10/whats-new-in-gutenberg-16-4-9-august/\">What’s new in Gutenberg 16.4?

In today&#8217;s episode, we will talk about the releases of WordPress 6.3 and 6.4, Gutenberg 16.3 and 16.4, and I&#8217;m your host, Birgit Pauli-Haack, curator at the Gutenberg Times and full-time core contributor for the WordPress Open Source project on the Automattic Five for the Future Program. And it&#8217;s a great pleasure for me to have with me today, Ellen Bauer. She&#8217;s a theme developer and 6.4 co-design lead on the release board. She&#8217;s also a co-founder of Elma Studio, a theme development shop and AinoBlocks is one of their products. Ellen has been a very early adopter of blocks and block themes and provided a ton of feedback to the core team. Thank you for joining me today, Ellen. Good evening to New Zealand. How are you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Thank you very much, Birgit. I&#8217;m very good. Yeah, I&#8217;m just excited to be here. And actually, coming on here has helped me a lot to catch up with all the things that are happening and it&#8217;s so exciting to see it all coming together. Yeah, I&#8217;m just really, really excited for 6.4 and to be part of it and all the things that are coming to WordPress. It&#8217;s really, really cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Excellent, excellent. So how is AinoBlocks doing? Do you have a theme and separate blocks for it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: So yeah, yeah, we do have blocks like block collection or single blocks. It was mainly we started that AinoBlocks to experiment with building blocks and bring blocks into our workflow and to make things happen that weren&#8217;t possible for a long time with just the default blocks. That&#8217;s just how it started, just to build the designs out that we wanted. And we still love to use a lot of the blocks there, especially we have an advanced grid block and things like that. We need to catch up on the spacing and things like that that came into default.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m planning to do that within the next one or two months to have a bigger update because what we&#8217;ve also been doing is building more block themes, coming back to our roots and back to themes because yeah, it&#8217;s now possible to build block themes and bring the two worlds together and just designing. We missed that with all just block building, we missed doing cool designs, but we didn&#8217;t want to build classic themes, too. So yeah, we were on hold for a long time. And now, we are really, really excited to get back into designing and we have a few cool new designs in the works and it&#8217;s just a lot of fun now to bring the worlds together and really create advanced and modern designs at WordPress. It&#8217;s really cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, I&#8217;m looking forward to your new designs and what you and Manu will come up with. So for our listeners, the last Changelog was a little bit was about four weeks ago, and a lot has happened in those four weeks. We will not cover it all and we hope you can catch up on the other news outlets on those 6.3 came out and 6.3.1, the release candidate was just released this week, will come out next week. We are recording this on August 25th, 2023, and 6.3.1 is scheduled to come out on August 29th. So for those who are binge listening to this at a later date, if you haven&#8217;t upgraded yet, do that now. 6.3.1 is coming out with some bug fixes for some of the features that surface quite late in the release cycle.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Announcements &#8211; WordPress 6.3 and 6.4</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of 6.3 or WordPress release, the roadmap for 6.4 was also just published this week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a tight release cycle with the first beta scheduled just four weeks from now, September 26 I think, and this makes it an ambitious list of features and updates. The release is set to be scheduled for November 7th, so there&#8217;s always the two months between beta or six weeks. No, it&#8217;s only five weeks, six weeks, five weeks between beta one and final release. So this one is quite special because the release was, is all about underrepresented gender people that lead the release in all release categories. And you are on design team, Ellen, I&#8217;m on the editor triage team with Anne McCarthy together, each of the release teams of two or three people deep. So what is the design team going to do in this release?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: So yeah, I&#8217;m just starting to get really into the work and kindly, Anne has, we have created a side channel in the Slack community for the design team and Estella did actually take the initiative on that. And kindly, Anne has posted and put together a list of tickets and things we are going to get into and some more people shared tickets and issues there. And then of course, the about page and yeah, we&#8217;re just getting started on that. It&#8217;s really exciting, I&#8217;m excited to be on the design team again and it&#8217;s really cool. Tammie Lister also is helping out and Rich put together a to-do list in the beginning, which was cool because last time, I joined for 5.6. Also for the underrepresented gender release, I was struggling at some points like what I&#8217;m supposed to do and when.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So yeah, this is way more organized now and yeah, it&#8217;s really cool to do it a second time and have a group of people who have also done it before and let&#8217;s just know more what is happening. And I&#8217;m really excited about the new default theme, too. That&#8217;s really cool that this is going to be added for 6.4 because we also had a new default theme released with 5.6 back then. I can&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s already two or three, I think last podcast, you said it&#8217;s three years ago. I was like, what? It&#8217;s crazy, but I guess it is. Yeah, so that&#8217;s really exciting and-</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. So the default theme leads are Jessica Lyschik and Maggie Cabrera.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Maggie. Yep.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And they just introduced the designs for the theme on a separate post and we will certainly share that in the show notes as well, as well with the roadmap, but that&#8217;s only one thing on the roadmap. The others are that there are two new features coming in. Well, at least one of them is the font library.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer:</em> Yes. So excited for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, that independent from themes, you can now have fonts on your site and manage them, or that&#8217;s the goal for it. So you&#8217;re not tied to a theme with the font, how your site looks and how your text is displayed independent from the theme. And there will be the backend is already working for that. That comes in in Gutenberg 16.5, so that is one of them. And Anne McCarthy&#8217;s post, she also had some designs already added to it, some pictures of it. Another part is the revisions for the styles were new in 16.3, but there were no revisions for templates and template parts and those will come with 16.4 there on the list.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We will have new blocks where a table of contents block has been long time in experimental, but it&#8217;s slated now to be released into core. There&#8217;s still a discussion about the time to read block because there is some, well, if you say okay, you have 30 minutes to read, that&#8217;s a normal, it normalizes how the reading capabilities, but if you are dyslexic or in other ways have accessibility issues, it&#8217;s ableism to give you how long you can read about this, that you&#8217;re not normal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that is definitely a discussion to have if we want to have that in core. So the discussion is ongoing. Another block would be the scrolling key block, which it comes out of the &#8217;90s and will never leave us scrolling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Yeah, I actually felt, I mean, we&#8217;ve seen that a lot in designs being trendy, but I was also surprised to see that as a core block in discussion. I mean, it&#8217;s cool that we don&#8217;t have to have custom solutions, but yeah, I&#8217;m most excited about the table of contents block. I remember last year, I was about to like, okay, should I have a custom block? Should I do that? And then I read, okay, it&#8217;s being done. So it&#8217;s cool to finally see that being added. Can&#8217;t wait for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And I was playing around with it or testing it, playing around equals testing and I always found it in the previous versions limiting because if I have a table of contents, I want to style it, I want to have some maybe different fonts, maybe different backgrounds, maybe different titles, a control over which heading goes in or out. I&#8217;m not sure that all my expectations will come in. So there is definitely room for a custom table of contents block, but I really don&#8217;t like when a table of contents that&#8217;s only 10 or 15 items long that has all the numbers and the indenting numbers in addition, that&#8217;s not additional information, any distracts, is this a priority or not. So I wasn&#8217;t really able to make it a bullet list, but I think that those things will be fixed definitely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then there&#8217;s also the image lightbox or each image block will have a feature that you can, with light box, zoom in on it or have a larger version on it on your screen. If you click on the image, that has been experimental in the Gutenberg for a while. I&#8217;m very excited about the order insert blocks because that is a piece that has been missing for since the beginning. I think that you can add something to a block that is not in the interface, like what would it be?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the example is a like button to add it to a comment, or another heading link or maybe just a citation or anything that you can put in dynamically that the user doesn&#8217;t have to control it. So I was thinking sometimes for the click to tweet, can we do this on a block? And it doesn&#8217;t have to be in a separate block, you can just put it in a paragraph or in a heading, or have an additional anchor on a heading without having to do a table of contents to get them automatically built. All these, they&#8217;re all different. I&#8217;m sure there are a lot of use cases for that, too, but I&#8217;m really excited that that is coming to the editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Yeah, I think so too. It&#8217;s, like you said, been missing for forever, just like you said, a like button or tweet button that yeah, it just makes it more attractive and easy to use blocks if you have these things auto inserted. Yeah, you don&#8217;t want to tweak around with these little items. I think that&#8217;s pretty cool. And I was surprised about the next one, the post formats. That&#8217;s pretty cool to come back to these ones. We have an old theme that&#8217;s like a post format Tumblr-style theme and it&#8217;s been ongoing popular with post formats, so it&#8217;s cool. We can maybe do a block version redesign for that theme, that would be amazing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, and post formats weren&#8217;t really tended to in the block editor at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Yeah, not at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So bringing that in, it&#8217;s definitely there has been some feedback that this is missing and some theme developers actually didn&#8217;t switch because it wasn&#8217;t available. So that is a good thing for adaptability, but it&#8217;s also with all the insecurities around the social networks and the fragmentation of it that many content creators are thinking about maybe building their own and just giving them post formats. And one of them is actually the non-title post that you just like a tweet, you get just 280 characters and put it in a post and you don&#8217;t need a title for it, and you have it on your website and then you can share it via an ActivityPub process with any of the social networks that you wanted to do. And you don&#8217;t have to go out and go directly to the social networks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: I always love that so much and I&#8217;m already excited to actually build a theme for these kind of purposes. And yeah, like you said, with Twitter not being there anymore, it&#8217;s sad. I feel for the first time actually really excited to start blogging again, and I think it will do that, just like a private blog because I don&#8217;t feel there&#8217;s the right home anymore on any social platform. And yeah, I really miss something and I&#8217;m really excited to use WordPress as not only for business websites and things like that, but actually for blogging again, which is funny and cool to come back to that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: I haven&#8217;t felt the urge to just blog for such a long time and now, I want to blog again. So yeah, that&#8217;s really exciting to see that. And I&#8217;m already seeing some new block themes come out of that project as well, which is pretty cool and creative.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And it&#8217;s certainly for writers and blogging, but it&#8217;s also for if you cherish Instagram just to share one photo and be done with it from your mobile phone and now you could do this with your own website, I think it would be just as well, but people who are interested in would follow your blog and your pictures on the blog. And if it has a nice theme that highlights that similar to Instagram or something like that, then and people can follow with a Jetpack or wordpress.com account, they can follow any blog they want. And I know that the ActivityPub plugin is now sponsored by Automattic and so we can create WordPress so it can actually push things into those social networks and even people following on the social networks, but you don&#8217;t have to create on those social networks, you are in control of your own posts and pages and pictures. And so I&#8217;m really, I think this is the most important thing for the web, for the independent web in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: I think so, too. I think so, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So I&#8217;m really, really great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Yeah. Seeing what can happen to these network, it just doesn&#8217;t feel right to just post your&#8230; Yeah, I feel exactly the same. I was like yeah, even Instagram, it doesn&#8217;t really feel good to post your content there. I was like, &#8220;I want to do it on my own website and still share there&#8221;, but yeah, I think yeah, we really make these experiences now and it&#8217;s cool. Yeah, it&#8217;s really exciting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: All right, yeah. And then also 6.4, the writing experience will have a focus on that. So the content creation flow on the writing part, like the distraction-free writing, list items, quotes and navigation items, getting additional capture toolbars and all this nice things. Then interfaces and tools like list view, top toolbars, command palette, they&#8217;re all getting additional enhancements or expansions. Site editing will get definitely additional UX polish and quality of life and also additional features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: I love the list view.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: It&#8217;s my favorite thing. So having the group locks, custom naming is like yeah, I mean, we have been asking for that for quite a while and it&#8217;s coming up. And now having that, it will be so cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, yeah, and then this…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: I mean for designing, the list view is just&#8230; We need to be in control.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Right, right, right. And if it&#8217;s just a group, group, group group, you don&#8217;t know where you are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Yeah, it&#8217;s awful and it will be cool. And for page patterns, having them like the sections ready with naming and stuff to get out to your customers and theme users, that will be just improving the whole experience because at the moment, it doesn&#8217;t look great, but I still love to use the list view.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, yeah. And yeah, there will be an expansion on the box shadow component, which is in the Gutenberg plugin. It&#8217;s also I think for one or two blocks available, but now it will be available for more blocks, of course. And then custom CSS enhancements are coming, more support for elements for individual blocks, and all these little but important things will get a refinement and enhancements. The same for the global styles, the style book especially, which is such a great help in previewing themes in designing, seeing how the style variations change your sites and all that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: I love that, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, that&#8217;s actually one of the big features in 6.2 and 6.3. 6.2 only was a little bit hidden in the global styles, but it brought forefront in 6.3 for the site editor in the site editor so you can directly access it. And another focus for 6.4 is the pattern, realm of patterns like the ability to set categories to update the inserter experience to improve the compatibility with non-block themes, which is still an issue. And another idea might not work with 6.4, but there&#8217;s definitely a stretch goal there to have partially synced patterns. Right now, we have either sync patterns or unsynced patterns, but sometimes you want to have update the style of a pattern and that replicate through previous posts or pages, but not the content. So you couldn&#8217;t do that right now, but there&#8217;s an effort to do that. Depending on how the testing goes and how easy it is to work with, it might make it into 6.4, it might not make it, but that is still&#8230; So there&#8217;s quite more navigation creation and management. Now that there&#8217;s the base is done, there&#8217;s some additional…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: It&#8217;s like never ending. It&#8217;s so cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: No ending, no.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: I saw the poster, I was like, &#8220;What is happening? This is so cool.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: I mean, it&#8217;s a lot of work. We will see how much we can get into with not a lot of time, but it&#8217;s exciting. I mean, at one point, these things will get added to the core, so very exciting to see that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. So when you go, dear listeners, to look at that roadmap post that will be linked in the show notes, you&#8217;ll also see links to the current GitHub issue or PR that is in the works about the certain items and you can then gauge how far it is along, how long it is, and also chime in and help with the testing. That would be really good. Another way of it is we will have a separate, there is a separate project board for 6.4 with quite a few items on it. More will be added to it of course, from this and from some of the tracking issues, and there you can follow along on the progress of in the next five weeks until we get to Beta 1. So all new enhancements, new things need to be in the release that are supposed to be in the release by Beta 1.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then it’s new feature freeze. And then after that, there&#8217;s only bug fixing in the beta cycle to release candidate one. There&#8217;s even possible to do some bug fixing afterwards, but then there&#8217;s also release candidate one string-free. So if there&#8217;s anything, user interfaces or something like that won&#8217;t get into the release after that because the translators are working on the translation of the new release. And so yes, it&#8217;s a long list for such a short turnaround time, but well, we don&#8217;t know where the boundaries are until we get to them. So we will report of course on the progress on things. We mentioned already the introducing of 2024, we will share the link in the show notes as well. What do you think?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: So I read the post that was posted yesterday by Jessica and maybe I think what we didn&#8217;t mention yet is so Maggie and Jessica are leading the theme development, but Beatriz actually did the design work for it. And yeah, I checked out the Figma file today this morning and I think it&#8217;s really, really amazing. I&#8217;m really excited. It seems like a lot of work, but I think a lot of people are already helping out with creating patterns and stuff. I hope maybe I have the chance to do one or two patterns as well if I find the time, or style variations I think is a topic that people can help out with creating and contributing like we did with the last default theme. But yeah, I think it&#8217;s beautiful, it&#8217;s very sophisticated, and I like that they&#8217;re working on different user cases. So I think there&#8217;s a blogger writer category and business, small business portfolio type or small business and yeah, and portfolio.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think the three are the main topics they want to cover with that theme and yeah, it looks beautiful. It makes me really excited and I think it fits to WordPress and the new WordPress we see. It&#8217;s really, really beautiful, I love it. And I think yeah, it&#8217;s really exciting to see all the patterns and page templates and all the things you can do because the last team had style variations, but not a lot of a layout building included so that&#8217;s going to be exciting. And that, combined with the free font library and the options there, really, really cool to see that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. I think we&#8217;re getting to a place where when you install WordPress for the first time and you use the default theme out of the box there that you have a headstart on getting your website finished just with the tools that come from the default theme. So there are two things that are not possible now, but that they&#8217;re working on for the 2024 that is that you can have templates, more than one template for a homepage. Right now, you can only have one. Well, the front page and yeah. And then if you create another one, it overrides that and it doesn&#8217;t give you a choice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s one thing, that would cover all the three use cases that you mentioned. And the other part is to actually also provide designs for the various post formats. And when you look into the post, there is one section there that shows you, or in the Figma file, there&#8217;s one section there that shows you just a mason gallery how the posts are, the different post formats are displayed. And I think that&#8217;s what you mentioned with your older theme, Ellen, that it&#8217;s still very attractive for people and I&#8217;m glad that we might have that out of the box.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Yeah, it&#8217;s really, really exciting. Yeah, and you can do so much with this theme. And I think, yeah, we never had that before, that default theme was really that flexible and people can really&#8230; Very usable, it looks very usable for the first time. I&#8217;m really, really excited. And the design is I think really fits to what WordPress has to offer. I think it&#8217;s a really great work, very exciting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And I&#8217;m looking forward to also seeing the page patterns. So when you create a new page that you can have a series of right now, you have to assemble the page yourself with various different patterns that might fit together or not. And with the page patterns, you have a single page fully created and you just need to change your content, the pictures and the content, but that it already gives you a blueprint for single pages, be it a service page or be it an about page or even the homepage. So I think that gives any user a head start with a new site or with an existing site that decides to have that theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: So true. And yeah, I remember really advocating for&#8230; We need page templates, page patterns, whatever we call it, but ready-to-go pages pre-designed for users to choose and have multiple options. We can imagine three or five about pages and they can choose because yeah, putting the patterns together is for, like a lot of users, still like a daunting idea and it&#8217;s overwhelming and why not provide it? We have patterns, we can do that. And yeah, we&#8217;ve also been doing that with our themes quite a lot and I think it&#8217;s really, really attractive to have that come together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. I have to say that, yeah, you have the feedback loop directly with your customers, so I&#8217;m glad that WordPress is on the right track there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Yeah, I think so because patterns just in general, it&#8217;s still, I mean, people getting more used to it but it&#8217;s really hard to understand for a lot of people, like what is that? It&#8217;s just a section? I want a page, and providing ready-to-go pages is just so much easier. It&#8217;s really, really cool to see that and have more themes, have that available. Maybe even, I remember saying that last year, even already discussing that, that we have next to a pattern library, like pattern directory, have a page pattern or maybe even there&#8217;s a new word that needs to be created for these patterns. Maybe not, maybe they can live in the pattern preview but they could be too long maybe for preview, I don&#8217;t know. But you have a library for that to theme independent available. I think that&#8217;s really, would be really attractive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, and that&#8217;s I think where the pattern category work comes in where you can categorize those patterns and also the browsing the previews. So if you have a bigger screen, you get a two-column preview of patterns that are under a certain category so you get a thumbnail view, how they&#8217;re big, and that works nicely, but those underpinnings had to first be built. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Yep. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It really comes together and I love what I see, yeah. It&#8217;s so funny that things, like I said last year, it felt like so much struggle to get people excited about block themes and site editing and now it&#8217;s coming together. I think with a little bit more practice, users will really just love it and forget about what we had before. It&#8217;s really cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Well, it also comes in handy that the navigation block editor has gotten a lot of improvements in 6.2 and 6.3.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: So true.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Community Contribution</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And Dave Smith, a core Gutenberg contributor, posted an update on it so you can read up about it, how it&#8217;s going to work, but because to be honest, I personally struggled after the first year trying to make navigation work beyond a simple navigation with pages to add a site logo to it or to add a search bar to it or something like that. It was definitely a struggle and it was not thought through, and I wanted to have multiple menus and now, that all came together in 6.3 with the site editor where you have multiple places where you can tap into the navigation and make adjustments, be it providing navigation places and just switch out the menu for that, that was not possible. Before, you had to remove the navigation block and add it again and then yeah, it was yeah, the…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Yeah, yeah, it was the biggest blocker I think for users to get into, they&#8217;re like, &#8220;It&#8217;s not working&#8221;. And yeah, like you said, very simple sites and then it ended. Yeah, very, very exciting to see that. I think now, yeah, just with that, people can really start building entire websites, block themes and stuff, it&#8217;s really tremendous work. And I can imagine it was difficult to get that right, or it&#8217;s still an ongoing process. But yeah, I&#8217;m really happy to see that, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, and that is, we&#8217;re just, it&#8217;s all I wanted to point out from hosts, from the themes and then now, we get into what is actually happening in the Gutenberg plugin.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Gutenberg 16.3 and 16.4</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So Gutenberg 16.4 was released on August 9th, so right after 6.3 was released, and certain items from the Gutenberg 6.4 release actually made it into 6.3. There were actually quite a few, I think 20 to 25 items. I have not identified them, but you will see it in the PR if you follow through the Changelog and click on one of the PRs and you want to know, it had a back port to WordPress release candidate labor that was added and then once it was back ported removed, you see that in the history of the PR. So Sarah Norris was the lead manager for the release manager for 16.4 and she wrote that it introduces exciting new features, including both a new experimental feature and a new component, and we will talk about what those are alongside many enhancement and bug fixes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bug fix highlights include many improvements to the recently added footnotes block and enhancements to patterns. The footnotes block, most of the bug fixes actually made it into 6.3 major release, WordPress release and some of the enhancement for patterns, too. Those were the two areas where there were last minute bug fixes that made it into the release. There were in total 184 pull requests authored by 60 contributors, including two new contributors, and the release has a list of all of them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Features</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the features that she mentioned, the new component was a basic progress bar component and in the release note, she also, Sarah also has some notes to that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s a horizontal progress bar component that can be used in various places and it replaces the spinner component for the site editor loading experience. Of course, these are public components that can also be used in third party or custom blocks or custom plugins, so there was that. It also gets some design tools with it as well. And it can be tested in the Storybook, which is other, it&#8217;s a different thing than the Style Book. The Storybook is for developers and on the WordPress GitHub repo, you can see the Storybook of all the components with all the attributes and you can test around just in isolation and then grab the code and add it to your own code base.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Yeah, I&#8217;ve just looked at that the other day with the progress bar and yeah, I think it&#8217;s definitely an improvement. And I&#8217;ve actually just opened the Storybook for the first time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh, really?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: It&#8217;s pretty cool to have.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Yeah. I&#8217;ve never seen that. But I used lots of these items for our blocks before, but I&#8217;ve never seen that. That&#8217;s great to know. It&#8217;s new to me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, I think we need to…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Was it? Yeah, no.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: It has been there since a long time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: I think it&#8217;s a long time, yeah. Maybe I have been there, I forgot about it. Maybe I have seen it, but pretty cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: If you click on the introduction, it says how the site works and the resources to learn more. And also, it has the code that you can add. It shows you different variables on things, attributes and how they look, so and so, and it also has, there is a section there for components experimental. If you go there, just be aware that it might, and progress bar is one of them, just it might change slightly of the course of development. We definitely need to promote that more that people can go through the Storybook and test some of the components and see how they work, what the documentation is about.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Enhancements</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So the next item on the Changelog is that now the keyboard shortcut for the command palette is now visible in the side view, it&#8217;s command K or control K, but I never remember keyboard shortcuts, so I&#8217;m glad that it&#8217;s now displayed in the header section of the site editor and so you can know it, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: I actually love shortcuts, but I also tend to forget them. So that&#8217;s handy because there are some cool ones and you can really speed up your workflow, especially if you&#8217;re really designing in WordPress, so that&#8217;s really cool. Yeah, I love to have the shortcut. Okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, I think you would really love to use the command palette for these quick steps things because you don&#8217;t have to click through all the menus to get there. So the command palette is a open page or add page and then you get a … or open page and then you get a list of the pages that are on the site and then you can select them without going to out of the site editor into the pages or from wherever you are and go to pages and then go down the menu items. So I really like the command palette, and that will definitely speed up content creation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Oh, true. Yeah, it&#8217;s really powerful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: What also comes with enhancement on the site editor, there are quite a few, but I&#8217;m only pointing out to that one. The pattern library, it switches to a three-column layout on use screen, so that is definitely&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: I love that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: That fills it all up. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Yes, I love that because we are building a lot of patterns and I was always like, can we just preview more?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: One thing I noticed with the pattern, like the explore all patterns view, I feel weird and I wonder if it&#8217;s just temporary or so because the two-column layout is like a light gray background because most of the patterns are most likely with a white background, in most themes at least. And then explore all patterns is a white background and it doesn&#8217;t look great. Have you noticed that? And I wonder, is that an error or is it just…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I think it would be something to make an issue out of on GitHub, but what you are referring to is the inserter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Yeah, yeah, yeah, that&#8217;s true.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And the switch to three-column layout on your screen, that&#8217;s on the site editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: In the site editor, okay, I get it. I get it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: In the patterns section of the site editor where you have the menu on the left-hand side.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Okay, okay. Yeah, of course, where on the site editor. Oh, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: In the site editor, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: But yeah, in the site editor, I have the dark background as I can see here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Yeah. Okay, that makes sense. I have to test that out again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, but it&#8217;s definitely worth I think creating an issue for the inserter to maybe also recognize some of the dark light contrast there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Yeah. I haven&#8217;t checked if there&#8217;s an issue and it&#8217;s also not consistent, why I have this light gray and then switch to white? Yeah, I will check it out if there maybe is an issue already or what&#8217;s going on there because yeah, it doesn&#8217;t really make sense.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: And I tested a few themes just to see if it was me, if I had it, but they all had the same issue. Maybe it&#8217;s temporary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And it might be even a good way to say that the browse all patterns goes to the site editor if it&#8217;s a block theme. With the classic theme, that wouldn&#8217;t work, but yeah. But to have that, that would go site editor. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: That makes sense, yeah. So true. Yeah, I mean, we just want to stay in the site there because it looks so nice and polished. That is true. It would be cool. I will test that out, maybe I can create an issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I&#8217;m just making a note there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: So now, we go into the post editing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, we are now here at the post editor. There are new commands available now to show or hide the block breadcrumbs. That&#8217;s I think on the bottom of things to get into switching off settings. So enable pre-published checklist or disable the pre-published checklist or change into, or just make a preview in the new tab. Those new commands for the power users there to switch off, on and off the settings so you don&#8217;t have to go through the menu items to go to the options bar and then change the settings for certain things. Even if you just want to toggle on and off and not have it permanently done, changed for your session.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: I love all the fine-tuning we are now at. It&#8217;s incredible to see that. Oh my god, all these little things happening that do make a difference, it&#8217;s so cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Speaking of, there&#8217;s the footnotes received in 16.4, add link background and text color support. So now, you can not only create the footnotes and they take on any styling from the theme, but now you can as a user also change the text color background and all that for your footnotes. That&#8217;s actually a very interesting new block, I really love it and I&#8217;m glad that it&#8217;s now in core to test it further on various use cases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: So true.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And then also, the…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: And then you have the pre-formatted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Get spacing support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. In 16.4, there were more additional enhancements to the blocks performance, you got the spacing support you said, yeah. And then in the words block, you can have now and even the line breaks so you can, instead of paragraph, you also can have line breaks there. Social links get the threads icon so you can have in your list of social profiles that you point people to also go to the new Threads environment of Facebook.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: That is good to have. I&#8217;ve yet to check out Threads. I mean, it&#8217;s good to have it. I think especially that since we don&#8217;t have Twitter anymore really, I&#8217;m excited. I want to try it. Have you tried it yet?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: No, and I&#8217;m also hesitant. It&#8217;s not rolled out to all Instagram users. So you need to have an Instagram account and what I saw…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Yeah, that&#8217;s true.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: &#8230; on certain platforms when people tried it was if you wanted to delete it again, you actually needed to delete your Instagram account…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Oh, wow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: &#8230; and I wouldn&#8217;t want to go there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: That&#8217;s not nice. Oh yeah, that&#8217;s not nice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So I wouldn&#8217;t going to go there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: That&#8217;s true.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Well, but on the other hand, yeah, maybe I should delete my Instagram account already.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: You can delete everything. Yeah, I mean, we don&#8217;t need more social platforms to be honest, I feel. But I&#8217;m always keen to check something new out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, we do. Me, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: It looks nice, it looks nice and simple and while you&#8217;re already at Instagram, but yeah, I think it&#8217;s weird that it&#8217;s connected with Instagram because I know how they&#8230; Maybe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I didn&#8217;t get it offered yet, so maybe because I&#8217;m not on Facebook, I&#8217;m only on Instagram, so I don&#8217;t know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Oh well, was it that maybe or could it be that this had something to do with European Union holding back with it? I think I have no clue. I didn&#8217;t follow it, but I think Manu mentioned something like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yes. Yes, you&#8217;re right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: So I think that&#8217;s it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: It&#8217;s only for US Americans and not for EU people. So that&#8217;s another reason.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Yeah. New Zealand somehow, we got lucky. We can use it, but I just didn&#8217;t have time yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Yeah. I think that&#8217;s the problem, which is actually good that they&#8230; But yeah, I don&#8217;t know where that will go, but it&#8217;s good to have the icon at least.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. Yeah, so true. Yeah. I just started being on Bluesky, I just got my invite so I just set it up. So I&#8217;m wondering if there&#8217;s actually a Bluesky icon already, so we&#8217;ll see. If not, I&#8217;m going to create an issue about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Yeah. Historically, I think I remember WordPress being always super late to add icons, so it&#8217;s cool that they&#8217;re faster now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. So next thing on our list is that unsync patterns didn&#8217;t come into the quick inserter. So if you started slash and started typing, you didn&#8217;t get a selection of your patterns. That is now&#8230; You can now do that. You find your patterns in there if you use the quick inserter. So that is&#8230; Also, if you search for it, you find them in the quick inserter. So I think that&#8217;s a really good enhancement. I was always wondering why I needed to go to the big blue button to get to my patterns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: That&#8217;s another big improvement with the sync patterns, unsync.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Definitely quality of life improvement. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: It&#8217;s so helpful for a user.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, absolutely. So we are almost at the end of what I wanted to point out as enhancements. Go and read the post release. I wanted to point out also that with this release, the plugin minimum supported PHP version is 7.0. I don&#8217;t think that anybody who uses a Gutenberg plugin is actually on 5.6, but just so if you are, now is the time and you want to be in touch with all the future releases, make sure that you upgrade your site to at least a 7.x version of PHP. That coincides with the WordPress 6.3 release that also bumps the minimum supported PHP version for WordPress to a 7.x PHP version. So 6.3 is the first version that does not support 5.6 anymore, PHP 5.5 versions, 5.x versions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Bug Fixes</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In the bug fixes, I found a few things that I wanted to point out because there were bugs that we had to deal with and we don&#8217;t, or maybe not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the cover block ContrastChecker, or the ContrastChecker that is in the sidebar to give a hint when your contrast between the foreground and the background color was not accessible or not high enough to be accessible, that algorithm didn&#8217;t work well with the cover block because of the combination between text, image, alpha overlay color and all that, that was way too much for the algorithm. So they disabled it for the cover block. They didn&#8217;t disable it for the InnerBlocks. So if you have InnerBlock a paragraph and you change the background color there and the text color of that doesn&#8217;t match, it still works. But for the cover block itself, it&#8217;s disabled because it had too many false positives and it was just the algorithm doesn&#8217;t go far enough. And then it&#8217;s better to not have it than having false positives in there. There&#8217;s, in the release in the PR, there&#8217;s also some discussion in there on why the team came to that decision.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: It could be that it&#8217;s maybe temporary or…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, I don&#8217;t know if there&#8217;s a focus on improving the ContrastChecker because that was an external tool, but it&#8217;s definitely just the nature of the cover block just has too many variables in there. So the image block finally got a fix on the image sides for the all wide and full width alignments. Sometimes that wouldn&#8217;t fill it all up or grab the wrong size, so this is now fixed. It has multiple variations there and it&#8217;s definitely a better feel for the image block when you add alignments there. And then the last one is that the video block got a fix for the styling. For the vertical alignment of the video, there was always a little gap on top of it. That was hard coded and they removed it. So if you fix it locally on your own theme or in your own site, you might need to look at it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: I think I saw that. Oh, I have to check that out. I haven&#8217;t used the video block quite often, but I mean, it is handy. I have to test it. I think I saw that once that it has this gap. I remember, I think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Any spacing is now with the space. So from the beginning, the spacer block was one of the most used blocks amongst the top five most used blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Oh my god, I never liked it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, but it helps. So made it easy for content creators to…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: That is true.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: &#8230; just adjust things, yeah. And now with dimensions controls, with padding and margin, it still is probably easier to use than figuring out, okay, what is padding and what is margin again? Is it inside or outside or what? Yeah, but it&#8217;s not that necessary anymore, especially when you have patterns and theme templates that actually took care and all of them put together. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: I&#8217;m not sure, but the problem was also that it was fixed, like a hundred pixels stayed a hundred pixels. Is it still like that? I don&#8217;t even know why.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: The spacer block? No, no.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Yeah, the spacer block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: It can say four, four pixels, 15 pixels, 150 pixels. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: No, I mean, does it responsive? The spacing, is it like fluid?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Is it fluid? I&#8217;m not quite sure. That&#8217;s a good question. I think it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Because that was the main reason why I never used it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Because it wasn&#8217;t fluid, yeah. Yeah, I think it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: I haven&#8217;t checked that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: &#8230; it&#8217;s definitely a good question.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Maybe we can&#8230; Now, we have spacing way better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And that&#8217;s fluid. So then on the post editor, you can allow styles to be changed dynamically through the editor settings. That is a PR that refers to the theme JSON. So you can I think, or to block extenders. Yeah, that&#8217;s for the extenders to update editor settings. Now you can make them dynamically. So you can have theme styles and then react to that, have through the editor provider. That&#8217;s highly technical and there is in the PR some example code for the experiments, but it helps theme developers or plugin developers to also change some of the styling dynamically, CSS or any other means. I think I&#8217;ll put that on the list of what&#8217;s new for developers on the developer blog. Where else? I think that we are on the end of 16.4 except for one more. There is an experiment for auto inserting blocks on the front end and the editor wire REST API. And the release post has an unusual amount of information about that, which is actually almost a… but it&#8217;s really cool how you can auto insert the&#8230; We talked about it, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We talked about it here at the&#8230; It&#8217;s the experimental auto insert on the block JSON file where you can then say, okay, on the core common template for instance, add as last. And you have before, you can add blocks before, after the block you added to or as a first child or last child through the block on the front end. So yeah, definitely try that out, test it. And definitely, there&#8217;s a tracking issue also linked in the release post so you can see what other plans are there for this feature because it&#8217;s still, as I said, experimental.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Documentation</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The documentation had a ton of changes, updates, and if you are struggling with some of the things because the documentation is not going far enough or deep enough, I would think that going through the release Changelog and look at the documentation issues to see what all changed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there is an API reference documentation for the interactivity API, which still is, it&#8217;s probably not coming for 6.4, but it&#8217;s definitely already in the Gutenberg plugin as a private API right now so core blocks can use it. There&#8217;s an update on the Gutenberg release process documentation. So if you are a contributor and you think about, &#8220;Oh, maybe I want to lead one of those Gutenberg plugin releases&#8221;, it&#8217;s definitely worth looking into it because it made it more fluid for new people that have had an experience with GitHub and Gutenberg, but they haven&#8217;t done a release yet. There&#8217;s also a getting startup guide for the interactivity API, started the block API version three has been documented now, and the create block package received support, for example, property and template defaults. So the scaffolding tool create-block is now a little bit more comprehensive in what it offers as a tool. I think that&#8217;s it. Any comments on those last three, four things that we talked about, I talked about?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Not too much. I need to check out the&#8230; That&#8217;s exciting that you mentioned the create-block tool because I love to use that. I haven&#8217;t used it for a while. Now, I need to come up with a new block idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Maybe not. I was so excited to do more design and theming again. I&#8217;m holding off with new block ideas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, you mentioned that you&#8230; Yeah, after creating so many custom blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Yeah, it&#8217;s a little bit&#8230; I loved it, but just working with customers that people, I think maybe because for us, knowing that we come from design and theme worlds, they get just way more excited about design and themes and patterns compared to blocks, the people who follow us in our work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, definitely, because you see something…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Yeah, yeah, visually.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: It&#8217;s haptical, yeah. I think the barrier for entry for custom blocks is sometimes a little harder. I can see that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Yeah, it was really good for me to get into it and having that skill and I enjoyed it, but it&#8217;s a lot of work with you really have to put a lot of effort into your block to make them work and make them competitive. And yeah, at the moment, I don&#8217;t know if we want to do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> We don&#8217;t do it because it&#8217;s easy, we do it because it&#8217;s hard, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: It is true, but it needs to make sense too. We just started building blocks because there was so much missing. And at the moment, we are fine with what we have. I mean, there are a few ideas we have maybe for blocks, but at the moment, we can build the designs we want to build with the blocks available and with our custom blocks so it works. And yeah, if we ever run into something we can&#8217;t do, then we will just create a block. Actually, if you get into it, it&#8217;s not, like for most of the blocks, for most things, it&#8217;s not so hard, it&#8217;s actually pretty easy now. It&#8217;s cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, and the create-block scaffolding tool has been worked on quite a lot in the last year and a half or so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Yeah. Yeah, it&#8217;s amazing. Yeah. In the beginning, I used to not like, I didn&#8217;t even have that available. Since we have that available, it&#8217;s really easy to, actually, it&#8217;s really easy to build custom blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And now, it&#8217;s a little bit more flexible as well because sometimes you, especially for agency developers who roll out just one plugin with all the blocks, you can now tell the scaffolding tool to just not create the whole plugin to just create a directory for one block and have the rest of it there. You can also distinguish between static block and dynamic block just with a command there or a flag respectively, and you can create your own templates. So if you have a process for creating blocks, you can make the tool work with your process as well with creating templates.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Gutenberg 16.5</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So Gutenberg 16.5 was released this week, actually yesterday, and the release was done by Sioban Bamber and her release post is also online. And this version is again, bug fixes and had a focus on enriching the command palette even more and customized some more of the blocks that had it featured 219 pull requests by 63 contributors, including five new.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we are not talking through 219 line items with you, we only pick a few and that is the command. And that is getting to through the features. There was added new block related commands again to the palette, which was the add block selection, block transforms, block duplicate, copy, remove, edit commands like that. So when you highlight something, you can then have a command that transform to, and then it gives you a list of blocks that you can. So it&#8217;s quite an interesting push on those command, creating new commands for that. If you want to follow along and you have plugins that use the block editor and the site editor, there is some documentation in the dev notes for 6.3 on how to create new commands that you can then add to your plugin. So definitely something to look into. There were also fixes to make it render well in smaller view ports and support the commands without icons and make it update the preview in new tab command to reuse the right module for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, and so those were some of the items that enhances the command palette. It also, in 16.5, there were some components updates and one of them is, we talked in 16.4 about the progress bar that also get additional update with this release 16.5, but there&#8217;s also an update to the modal component that it adds now a header action prompt to enable buttons or other elements to be injected into the header, which is pretty cool. And then enhances the overlay into action as well. So that is of course so much more interesting for developers, but it also is developers for blocks as well as for plugin developers because they can reuse the WordPress components.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The column block received two enhancements. One is a stretch option for the blocks vertical alignment options, meaning that if a two-stretch through the full column, even if the others were longer. So if you have a three-column block, then one column can be shorter or longer than the other columns. And that was hard to correct with a spacer block, we talked about it, but that of course what a spacer block was good for. And now, you have a vertical alignment option where you say, okay, just stretch this to the full space. And then especially when you have backgrounds on them, it looks much nicer when the backgrounds are all in the same length of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: That&#8217;s very helpful. I haven&#8217;t actually tested that, but it sounds very helpful. I have to retest it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Well, anybody should test it to see it actually does what you want it to do.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: That sounds really helpful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, I&#8217;ve struggled with that every time when I use a columns block that my columns are not lined up and then I fiddle 90% there and then the last 10%, I fiddle a half an hour with a spacer block to get it all matching up in that, yeah. And the second enhancement I wanted to mention is that now, if you press enter on an empty paragraph at the end, then you get exit out of the columns block. There was no way to, with a keyboard, to get out of the columns block. Now you can when you&#8217;re done writing and then you hit enter on an empty paragraph at the end of the block that you get out of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: That also makes a lot of sense.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Yeah. I haven&#8217;t used the columns like that much, to be honest, myself. I have to check it out again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, it&#8217;s much more versatile now, especially with the different backgrounds for each column, different&#8230; You can do all kind of different&#8230; The single column has now so many design tools that it&#8217;s really helpful for your designs. There was some lacking design tools. They were only available for the full, for the columns block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: For the main.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, for the main column and now, it&#8217;s all you get…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: For the…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: &#8230; yeah, for the single column. Yeah, we always have to distinguish between the columns block and the column block. Yeah, and then other block updates like the file block got spacing options, the image block got aspect ratio support for the light box, the post content block got color controls. And this is the last one I wanted to mention is that the block titles have been changed to remove posts from it. So those are the ones like post author, post title, post content, post&#8230; Yeah. So because they&#8217;re pretty redundant, if it&#8217;s a title.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Yeah, there were a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: &#8230; can be a post title and a page title and then it&#8217;s the author, but it&#8217;s the post author block on a page, why would I do that? So it makes more sense, but it also changes the alphabetical list of things. So if you wanted to look for titles, you always put title in and it gave you in the inserter the post title, but now it just says title. So some people are all very tuned in into what they see in the inserter and this makes the visual inserter a little bit different when it doesn&#8217;t have posts in it, yeah. They might not recognize it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. So the global styles now got a feature to reset to the default global styles revision thing, and then also reduce the visibility check on two to one revision. So you don&#8217;t&#8230; Yeah, if you only have one revision, there is no visibility check there. That&#8217;s just one of the refinements of things. On the block editor, there&#8217;s now a…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: That is the&#8230; I haven&#8217;t actually looked into that, allow the layout controls to be disabled per block from theme JSON, but that sounds very helpful. But the next one, the fluid typography at minimum and maximum view port for that, like the theme JSON we can, in a theme, can configurate that ourselves. That&#8217;s what it means, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Right, right. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Yeah, that&#8217;s so helpful because yeah, that&#8217;s something that didn&#8217;t really work for now, like creating designs with especially a larger typography sometimes. You only want that obviously in larger screens and you couldn&#8217;t really control it. That&#8217;s really, really helpful to have. I love that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. There was also a bug fix in an earlier version, I don&#8217;t know it was 16.2 or 16.1 where you could also, it changed the progression from screen size, a big font down to smaller screen sizes, it now has a different algorithm to do that, so it actually works. So it actually goes smaller on a smaller screen. Sometimes when you have, I don&#8217;t know, 160 big letters, even if you scroll them down to a minimum size, it wouldn&#8217;t scroll down. But now, you can also hard code those minimum and maximum with the theme JSON. So it&#8217;s even more control now than you just rely on the algorithm to do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Yeah, and also the layout controls. I mean, from my perspective, anything that we can get control of where theme JSON is amazing because yeah, it just makes it so much more flexible to have everything there. So to disable the layout controls per block basis I think is also pretty neat. I love to see that. Yeah, it&#8217;s really cool to see that there&#8217;s just more fine control and yeah, things just start to work way better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So what else is in there? I&#8217;m scrolling, scrolling through that what I wanted to do. But in the block editor, there&#8217;s also one PR that didn&#8217;t get any notice anywhere else except here in the Gutenberg Changelog, but also in Gutenberg Changelog podcast that there&#8217;s now support for container queries in editor CSS. Container queries means okay, if the container is something, the CSS changes in opposed to view port or media queries. And what happened was when if you enqueued a CSS file that used container queries, there would be an error message on the block editor. And that has been fixed and now, theme developers and designers can now use container queries in their CSS files without any problems with the block editor. I think that&#8217;s a step in the right direction because container queries are the new thing with CSS for, well, I don&#8217;t know how long, but I think it&#8217;s a better way to make a website or design flexible on screen size or container size rather than&#8230; The browser size rather than the screen size.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that is definitely a step in the right direction to be a little bit updated with the modern CSS. For developers, again, interesting that the style engine now includes namespace in layout class names for non-core blocks. So it&#8217;s a very slight change, but it makes it so much more controllable that you now can use a theme slugs namespace on your class names for your core blocks and it&#8217;s still for your blocks, your custom blocks, and it will be in the style engine and you can use your CSS. It&#8217;s consistent, you don&#8217;t have to&#8230; It&#8217;s not so arbitrary anymore. And you can override your other people&#8217;s stuff when you can add your namespace there. It looks a little bit unwieldy when you look at the CSS class name, but it&#8217;s definitely like so before, it only said my block, my test block is layout-constrained and now, my block, create-block, my test block is layout-constrained. So it adds the namespace just after the WP block in your CSS automatically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Wow. Yeah, that makes sense. It just gives you more control.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Gives you more control and isolate certain CSS in class names. Yeah. All right.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Experiments</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two, no three experiments now in Gutenberg. One is the backend for the fonts library is now in the plugin, and then there is also a feature to connect a paragraph to a meta custom field. So there is an effort to have a user interface to connect certain blocks attributes to a custom field, and this is the first test. It&#8217;s very early, there is a little UI with it, but that is definitely something for extensibility for plugin developers to test out that you can, when you register your meta field, that you also can add them to the sidebar and allow connections to certain blocks with it. I think that&#8217;s a terrific idea and it fills a gap that is missing, and it helps with implementers when they use something like ACF to create meta fields and then they can just add them to a decent blocks, but it&#8217;s very early stages so it needs people to be testing but also to discuss that with the core developers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the last one is a bootstrap minimal sync package. Well, it doesn&#8217;t, the name of the PR doesn&#8217;t really tell you what it actually is, but it&#8217;s part of the real-time collaboration efforts for phase three. Riad has put in little experiments and it&#8217;s really just a prototype or a proof of concept where you can have multiple people work on posts at the same time and see how that works. It uses the team has decided or thinks that the best external library to use is the Yjs library that uses web sockets and other in the pipeline tools. And yeah, it&#8217;s just the beginning of that little piece of it. And if you read through the PR, you hear a lot that&#8217;s not working, but the things, the main thing should be working. So test it out, try it out and just see how it feels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: I mean, that&#8217;s exciting to be able to start looking into it. I want to try it out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, I think Riad did two years ago, already had a site that&#8217;s called asblocks.com where he tested some of that already. So this is bringing it into the Gutenberg repo and see how it works with actually a real implementation, yeah. So I&#8217;m just looking also at the fonts library. There is in the PR, it&#8217;s a backend test, but in the PR, there is a video where you can see how it would fit into front end view as well. I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s UI yet in there, but the experiment is you need to turn it on so you as a developer can use the REST endpoints to figure out how you can include it into your plugin. If you are a plugin developer that works with fonts and has some of the functionality in there, it&#8217;s probably good to start working with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Documentation</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>And then there we are again, a ton of updates in the documentation, especially I just want to point out one page and that&#8217;s the page curating the editor experience because it also now includes how to include the starter patterns for templates and that it&#8217;s documented now, but that page is something I point many people to when they say, &#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t want our users to have access to this, that and other&#8221; and I said, &#8220;Well, you have tools to make them disappear, to disable things or to curate that a little bit further&#8221; and that&#8217;s the page that I point people to when they need to explore how they can switch off some of the functionality or some of the features of the design controls and global styles as well. Do you have any&#8230; Oh no, no, one more. I&#8217;m sorry, one more for the benefits and…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: It&#8217;s a lot, I mean…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: It&#8217;s a lot, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: It&#8217;s a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: For Node and NPM, no?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: For the building tool update, get update?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. The Gutenberg repo now update the minimum node version to 16 and NPM version to eight. Up until now, I was still working on minimum version 14 and I think six for NPM, but now you need at least be on 16 and on eight for NPM to build with Gutenberg and to, in some of the packages, require now the higher versions. It was mainly updated for I think the fund&#8217;s API, well, I&#8217;m not quite sure, I&#8217;m sorry. I might be misleading. There was a reason why it was happening now because one of the features, either the interactivity API or the fonts API or something like that, required a higher version of it. And so now, yeah, all the build processes now. So on the repo, you might want to rebase them and update your node install. Yeah, other external libraries also got updates like the Storybook or Learner or TypeScript Storybook is now on version 7, Learners on 7.14 and Typescript on 5.1, but that&#8217;s all for now. Now, we are at the end of it. Did you see anything that you wanted to explore that we overlooked?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: No, I got a bit more quiet to the end of it. I&#8217;m sorry. It&#8217;s like I&#8217;m sliding into bed time time-wise, sadly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So what time is it there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: My energy level goes a little bit down. Yeah, it&#8217;s not that late. It&#8217;s just like toddler mom late. It&#8217;s 10:00.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh, yeah. No, it&#8217;s getting close to my bedtime too. So I only have one more thing on the agenda for today and that is the admin design kickoff post that was posted by section. And we only can, our listeners certainly need to go there and read it themselves, but yeah, dear listeners but also go there especially…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Very exciting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: &#8230; it&#8217;s very exciting and it shows you where the site editor design can merge into WP admin in various different ways. And which part of it excites you most? You read through it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: The merge part because yeah, this side editor, it just looks like yeah, so it&#8217;s more modern and I can&#8217;t wait for it to merge as much as possible, as fast as possible. Just yeah, because it just represents what WordPress has to offer way more, like coming from a design background myself too. Yeah, we just want to see, see it more clean and modern and just more exciting to work in it, I think, and just more attractive, to make it more attractive to new users and it&#8217;s just beautiful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And I like…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: And I love the site editing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. Design?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Yeah, the design of the site editing. So I can&#8217;t wait to have all of WordPress look like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh, I think you need to have some patience because…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: I know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: &#8230; it&#8217;s going to take many, many major releases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: I know. Yeah, sadly. If it would be up to me, we would do tomorrow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, you and me both. I know. But what I like about it is that it&#8217;s more contained. So when you have a plugin right now, a plugin can put itself into the menus on the left-hand side and it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Yeah, yeah, that surround it. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: But now, you have a plugin section and then a plugin, and then whenever you click on it, the plugin takes over your screen, but it&#8217;s all plugin-oriented. So you have your tabs, you have your everything. And if you want to get out of the setting, you just do the back button and you&#8217;re back to the WordPress part. I really like those.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: That&#8217;s true. Yeah. I mean, that&#8217;s the biggest complaint too. We hear from people that it&#8217;s like if a plugin can take over WordPress, it looks wild and it&#8217;s sad for WordPress when that happens. And all the promotions and whatever some people put in there, we don&#8217;t want to have that. And also finding plugin settings because some put them there and others there, and I think it just grew organically and we have to now improve that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And I think it&#8217;s also…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Just for users, I mean, it&#8217;s for the users. We do it not to punish people, but to make it a better user experience because at the moment, it&#8217;s just suffering.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: But I also can see that it&#8217;s so much helpful for the plugin developers to have a coherent WordPress design system that they can rely on and don&#8217;t have to come up with all the interfaces themselves because that code needs to be managed and maintained.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: I like that you say that. And probably at the moment, a lot of people won&#8217;t agree, but I think too, you have to control that experience. I like it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Well, then the control of the experience you still have, just the design. So the user sees the same components over and over again and knows what to do with them. And what they do is the plugins definitely have a freedom on there, but I think if some of the plugins that are really big plugins can rely. And we had a live Q&amp;A on the Gutenberg Times about that with the people from the developers from GiveWP, they do their whole revamp of their plugin based on the WordPress packages and components so that the open source project is actually maintaining their code. And they did additional of course customization on that, but they only have to maintain those instead of the whole plugin.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Makes their life easier. Yeah, makes everyone&#8217;s lives easier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, and also the…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: I think so, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: &#8230; and also the feedback loop is now about WordPress&#8217; core elements and not about what the plugin can do and the bug fixes can be in core. It&#8217;s fixed upstream instead of just in the plugin, if there is something there that needs to be fixed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: That makes sense. Yeah, I love that. I can&#8217;t wait.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Dear listeners, I don&#8217;t know if I shared that post with you, but I will post it again in the show notes with the live Q&amp;A with the GiveWP developers, Jason Adams and John Weinstein probably yeah, it was the beginning of July. We had that live Q&amp;A and we have the transcript and the video and all the resources there, so you can follow up on that. Anyway, well, it was so great to walk with you through those Changelog items.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ellen, thank you so much. And before we come to the end, do you have any announcements or comments that you will like our listeners know? And if people want to get in touch with you, where is a good spot to find you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: So first of all, thank you for having me. Yeah, I hope I could contribute a little bit to this episode.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: A lot, a lot. Yes, no.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Yeah, so getting in contact with&#8230; So we have our website, ElmaStudio on AinoBlocks both work. And yeah, I&#8217;m still on, I still call it Twitter, I don&#8217;t care. Instagram and YouTube. I actually just about to get into creating a few new YouTube videos, so it&#8217;s all Elma Studio there on all the socials, except Twitter is my name, Ellen Bauer. Yeah, just on our website. And news is just that we are about to finish a new free theme and it&#8217;s inspired by the statement I made earlier that I just wanted to blog again. So we&#8217;re going to do a little blog theme that was just a design idea we had, Manu and I had and we are like, &#8220;Just, let&#8217;s do it.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m actually excited to create a little private blog on this design and we have it almost ready, I think. I hope it will land in the WordPress arc repository within the next four weeks or so, depending on what we still need to do. And then there&#8217;s a second one in the works as well that is just a wrap up of a redesign we did, and we had all these materials and patterns and templates ready and we&#8217;re like, &#8220;Let&#8217;s do a theme out of that&#8221;. So that&#8217;s going to be another free theme coming as well. Yeah, just fun projects we did over the last month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I&#8217;m looking so much forward to that. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Yeah. We just wanted to create something simple for a change and we&#8217;re like, &#8220;Let&#8217;s do that, just simple block themes or easy smaller themes, make them free themes&#8221;. So that&#8217;s what we did just out of fun, which is cool to do that too. Yeah, so that&#8217;s coming from us. Others, I don&#8217;t have anything else to say except thank you for having me. It was really exciting and it helped me a lot to catch up on things actually, which is so cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh, good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: And yeah, I&#8217;m just amazed and excited about all the changes coming and all the fine-tuning. It&#8217;s really so, so cool to see WordPress coming together in that way. Like you said, with the admin and stuff, it&#8217;s still a way to go, but I mean, we can see the first glimpses of that and really beautiful to see WordPress going into that direction. I&#8217;m really excited.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Well, I&#8217;m glad to be working with you on the 6.4 release. And dear listeners, before we end the show, I want to remind everyone the show notes will be published on gutenbergtimes.com/podcast. This is episode 88.

On WordPress as a platform for empowerment and change, Josepha shared, “The more people that know about WordPress, the more people can access the incredible opportunities that WordPress can provide.” And that sustaining the platform for future generations ensures these opportunities will persist. She added, “We exist for as long as people want to use our software.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The community is the key to sustaining WordPress, and Josepha touched on the importance of WordCamps, workshops, and events that create value, promote inclusivity,&nbsp; and spark inspiration. WordPress can be a catalyst for positive change in the life of a contributor, end user, or site builder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Concluding her keynote, Josepha asked the audience to think about the story they’d want to tell about themselves and their time in WordPress; and the story they would want WordPress to tell the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What’s Next for Gutenberg</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Matt began his keynote with a touch of nostalgia, referring to a comment on his personal blog in 2003 by WordPress Co-founder <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/mikelittle/\">Mike Little</a>, and then looked ahead to the most recent release, WordPress 6.3. As this year’s largest release, it includes new features such as the Command Palette, a quick way (⌘+k on Mac or Ctrl+k on Windows) to search your site and access common commands.</p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/download/releases/6-3/\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"535\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/08/6.3-Release-Edition-Featured-Image.png?resize=1024%2C535&ssl=1\" alt=\"WordPress 6.3 Lionel\" class=\"wp-image-15795\" /></a>\n\n\n\n<p>Matt continued, “WordPress never rests, so right around the corner is <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/6-4/\">WordPress 6.4</a> on Nov 7… with some cool new features.” He shared that 6.4, like 5.6, will be an underrepresented gender-led release. A new default theme, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/08/24/introducing-twenty-twenty-four/\">Twenty Twenty-Four</a>, is tailored for entrepreneurs and small businesses, photographers and artists, and writers and bloggers. Additionally, 6.4 will feature integrated font management and Image block options to expand single images for optimal viewing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking further into the future, Matt highlighted Phase 3 of the Gutenberg project, which will focus on workflows and collaboration, “moving WordPress from a single-player to a multi-player tool.” In that spirit of collaboration, a new <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C05PY7QLR5F\">#LMS</a> working group will also bring WordPress learning management systems together to improve the web standards for courses and learning content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond Phase 3, Matt shared thoughts about what it means to support WordPress many years from now. A new <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/100-year/\">100-Year Plan</a> from WordPress.com is an exploration into long-term planning for your online presence. He encouraged attendees to be inspired by the region&#8217;s history, reflecting on what it would mean to honor the past while anticipating and planning for the future.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Q&amp;A</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A Q&amp;A session followed the keynotes, with questions submitted by the in-person audience and live stream viewers.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Additional questions will be answered in a future post on <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/project/\">make.WordPress.org/project/</a>.

Users now have access to more block-related commands for block transforms and block actions, including the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>all transforms&nbsp;<em>to</em>&nbsp;the block has defined (e.g. to cover, to gallery, to columns, to file, to group, to media and text, for an image block)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>these block actions: paste styles, copy, ungroup, group, moveTo, insertAfter, insertBefore, remove, duplicate)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Together, these new commands not only enrich the command palette’s functionality but also improve the distraction-free mode by offering immediate access to basic functions,&#8221; Automattic-sponsored Gutenberg contributor Siobhan Bamber said in the release post.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Improving the discovery of these new commands may prove challenging. Contributors are <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/52509#issuecomment-1638161344\">exploring</a> displaying the contextual actions as suggestions immediately after opening the command palette, to scale with the increasing index of available commands.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Since the aim of this PR is to add so many commands, let&#8217;s not surface any suggestions yet,&#8221; Automattic-sponsored designer James Koster said. &#8220;We can explore that in a follow-up with a thought-out design which considers how to scale the display of so many commands, if necessary.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Command Palette design was also updated in this latest round of version 16.5. Users with a keen eye may notice a new search icon aligned to the right, a reduced width, darker icon color, and more subtle changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1200\" height=\"908\" src=\"https://149611589.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/updated-command-palette.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-148244\" />image credit: Gutenberg PR <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/53117\">#53117</a>\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenberg 16.5 adds more block supports to the Details block, Post Content block, and File block to make them more customizable with controls for colors, block spacing, and padding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This update includes many more small enhancements and bug fixes, including improvements to the writing flow, build tooling, fluid typography, existing Command Palette commands, Snackbar component, and Global Styles.

Canadian universities encourage students to come out with unique research ideas and provide monetary benefits in the form of scholarships for research work. In addition, the government and industries give students with exceptional research ideas support to put additional efforts to make it a success. To name a few –medicine, agriculture, computer science, environmental science, and telecom; there are abundant research options available in these fields.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p id=\"viewer-cu4be\">What have you planned once you are through with your studies in Canada?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p id=\"viewer-anhi5\">Canada offers endless opportunities for all.

Please see below:</p><h6>ENVATO PTY LTD</h6><p>For the purpose of validating and getting your purchase information regarding licenses for our theme, we send your provided tokens and purchase keys to Envato Pty Ltd and use the response from their API to register your validated support data. See the Envato privacy policy here: <a href=\"https://envato.com/privacy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Envato Privacy Policy</a>.</p><h6>TICKSY</h6><p>Ticksy provides the support ticketing platform we use to handle support requests. The data they receive is limited to the data you explicitly provide and consent to being set when you create a support ticket. Ticksy adheres to the EU/US “Privacy Shield” and you can see their privacy policy here: <a href=\"https://ticksy.com/privacy-policy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ticksy Privacy Policy</a>.</p>		\n		<h5>7. HOW LONG WE RETAIN YOUR DATA</h5><p>When you submit a support ticket or a comment, its metadata is retained until (if) you tell us to remove it. We use this data so that we can recognize you and approve your comments automatically instead of holding them for moderation.</p><p>If you register on our website, we also store the personal information you provide in your user profile. You can see, edit, or delete your personal information at any time (except changing your username). Website administrators can also see and edit that information.</p>		\n		<h5>8. SECURITY MEASURES</h5><p>We use the SSL/HTTPS protocol throughout our site. This encrypts our user communications with the servers so that personal identifiable information is not captured/hijacked by third parties without authorization.</p><p>In case of a data breach, system administrators will immediately take all needed steps to ensure system integrity, will contact affected users and will attempt to reset passwords if needed.</p>		\n		<h5>9. YOUR DATA RIGHTS</h5><h5>GENERAL RIGHTS</h5><p>If you have a registered account on this website or have left comments, you can request an exported file of the personal data we retain, including any additional data you have provided to us.</p><p>You can also request that we erase any of the personal data we have stored. This does not include any data we are obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or security purposes. In short, we cannot erase data that is vital to you being an active customer (i.e. basic account information like an email address).</p><p>If you wish that all of your data is erased, we will no longer be able to offer any support or other product-related services to you.</p><h5>GDPR RIGHTS</h5><p>Your privacy is critically important to us. Going forward with the GDPR we aim to support the GDPR standard. AncoraThemes  permits residents of the European Union to use its Service. Therefore, it is the intent of AncoraThemes  to comply with the European General Data Protection Regulation.

THIRD PARTY WEBSITES</h5><p>AncoraThemes  may post links to third party websites on this website. These third party websites are not screened for privacy or security compliance by AncoraThemes  and you release us from any liability for the conduct of these third party websites.</p><p>All social media sharing links, either displayed as text links or social media icons do not connect you to any of the associated third parties, unless you explicitly click on them.</p><p>Please be aware that this Privacy Policy, and any other policies in place, in addition to any amendments, does not create rights enforceable by third parties or require disclosure of any personal information relating to members of the Service or Site.

Please review the privacy policy and terms of service for each site you visit through third party links.</p>		\n		<h5>11. RELEASE OF YOUR DATA FOR LEGAL PURPOSES</h5><p>At times it may become necessary or desirable to AncoraThemes, for legal purposes, to release your information in response to a request from a government agency or a private litigant. You agree that we may disclose your information to a third party where we believe, in good faith, that it is desirable to do so for the purposes of a civil action, criminal investigation, or other legal matter. In the event that we receive a subpoena affecting your privacy, we may elect to notify you to give you an opportunity to file a motion to quash the subpoena, or we may attempt to quash it ourselves, but we are not obligated to do either. We may also proactively report you, and release your information to, third parties where we believe that it is prudent to do so for legal reasons, such as our belief that you have engaged in fraudulent activities. You release us from any damages that may arise from or relate to the release of your information to a request from law enforcement agencies or private litigants.</p><p>Any passing on of personal data for legal purposes will only be done in compliance with laws of the country you reside in.</p>		\n		<h5>12.

Are you planning to study abroad? Are you deciding the right path for your future?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p id=\"viewer-db73s\">Alas! So many questions to answer and much to plan and think about! Fret not; these all can be answered, and some solutions can work best for a glorious future. After all, none of us has come so far without these questions in mind. Let us check out this amazing country, Canada, with a lot to offer.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p id=\"viewer-3u8ca\">But why Canada?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p id=\"viewer-ffknc\">Canada offers a wide range of courses in many disciplines, be it marketing &amp; management, architecture, medicine, arts, nursing, and many more in government as well as private institutions. You must have surely heard about Elon Musk, Malcolm Gladwell, Lily Singh, and Margaret Atwood, some of the renowned names who studied in Canada. Let us list some of the top-ranked universities in Canada:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p id=\"viewer-f5jnh\">• University of Toronto</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p id=\"viewer-2c8lk\">• The University of British Columbia, Vancouver</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p id=\"viewer-a6hmk\">• University of Alberta, Edmonton</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p id=\"viewer-3eief\">• University of Montreal</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p id=\"viewer-cikmu\">• McMaster University</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p id=\"viewer-84jf\">• Western University</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p id=\"viewer-2kgtf\">• University of Calgary</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p id=\"viewer-ci70t\">• University of Waterloo</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p id=\"viewer-2rh2l\">• University of Ottawa</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p id=\"viewer-apntj\">Canada is a vast country with enormous opportunities and a great place to study, offering great prospects. If you are looking for a country that offers good colleges not digging deep into your pockets, Canada gives you that opportunity, as the cost of higher studies is less compared to other countries abroad. Canada is a country that is not expensive to stay in and offers good career options with a high standard of education and a low unemployment rate.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p id=\"viewer-9j42u\">Some of the top educators and academicians are associated with the top most internationally recognized universities. The universities offer high-quality education with excellent internship opportunities. To add, the government policies are quite liberal regarding post-study work and immigration. Another advantage of studying in Canada for international students is the scholarships offered to eligible students, which help reduce the financial burden. Canada also allows studying and working for students pursuing higher studies.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p id=\"viewer-cpv7p\">Scholarships</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p id=\"viewer-2sg08\">Students who excel academically, show exceptional creativity and leadership in school, and can be distinguished from others are applicable for a merit-based scholarship. The school can also nominate students for the University of Toronto\'s Lester B. Pearson International Scholarship.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p id=\"viewer-1alcj\">Research opportunities in Canada</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p id=\"viewer-2rm4h\">One of the important parts of higher education in Canada is Research, which also plays a crucial role in deciding a student to study in Canada. Canadian universities encourage students to come out with unique research ideas and provide monetary benefits in the form of scholarships for research work. In addition, the government and industries give students with exceptional research ideas support to put additional efforts to make it a success.
